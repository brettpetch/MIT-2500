# Letters: Pre-Internet Communicative Practices
>I have been looking over all the letters that I have received to day, and
there are only three in which the writer does not say that he ( or she) has
nothing to say, which is a most preposterous fact.
- Henry Howard Meyrick
>Ihe letters I receive from home create much too powerful an excitement
in my mind to call it a pleasurable sensation. It is a painful sensation
occasioned by pleasure and memories softening influences over friendship,
distant but not forgotten, that makes me deeply sensible of the strength
of that tye that binds me to home, perhaps more powerful in its influence
than even the allurement of gain or riches.

## Introduction
To be a colonizer in Australia in its early settler years was to be truly at a distance from family, friends and business partners who were more often than not located in Great Britain. Communication was reliant almost entirely on letters, with the only occasional adjunct being verbal reports when, for example, someone returned to Great Britain and was able to pass on first-hand news and reports of those still in the colony. 

Letters from the period 1788 until 1872 (when Australia was linked to the United Kingdom by telegraph) were not only physically at a distance but considers 'The black swan's quill does not succeed' (MS 7959 Hl5789-Hl5816, 10 September 1841). Nowhere else were there found mentions of the basic technological items of ink, paper, sealing wax and so on.

Similarly, potential changes in handwriting were tracked but none were obviously found and no mention was made in any letter of someone's handwriting, whether of it improving, worsening, staying the same or anything related. It was however noticeable while handling letters that, and this may seem obvious but it was striking, the signature and handwriting were clearly thematically linked being born from the same style of writing of an individual. Thus the handwriting, whose mere form must have been familiar to some readers, was reinforced and confirmed as identifying someone through the 'look and feel' of the signature being close to that of the message. Rather than presenting this as separate quantitative result it is integrated into the signature's role in establishing the body that writes, because of the role of the shape of handwriting in reinforcing the signature's relation to the handwriting in the message.

This analysis establishes an initial uniform set of practices for writing letters. These are a greeting and a farewell, placed at beginning and end, a signature on all and a seal on folded letters, with contributory practices of identification between the shape of handwriting and the shape of the signature. There were other practices we might intuitively have expected for which no routine or pattern was found. Two such are a date and location placed at the start of the letter above the greeting. Dates were irregularly used in letters, both in terms of actually stating the date and where it was stated. For example, dates might be mentioned as part of the letter's discussion of an event or in identifying a business deal but it was usually unclear if this was also the date of the letter or near it, so it was unclear if dates were part of the meaning of letters or of what I am separating out here as material practices. All that was clear was that a practice of writing a date near the greeting at the beginning of the letter was not routine. It may simply be that writers and readers were able to assume the date of the letter from the postmark from when it is sent, after all with folded letters the postmark would always be present, unlike with envelopes when the letter might be retained and the envelope with the postmark discarded.

Similarly, stating where the letter was written from was not a routine practice. Again, letters variably stated locations, though with no clear pattern of stating where the writer's location was, but this appeared to be more closely related to the telling of stories within letters than to a routinized practice of stating the location. Again, postmarks usually stated locations and it may be that no need to state the location was felt as the postmark would be on the same piece of paper as the message.

Even more so than the previous category of material practices, practices of 'meaning' as communicative practices are primarily a qualitative set of procedures and routines. For example, it was not possible to quantitatively code the shifts in the content of greetings and farewells as these were closely dependent on their contexts for their significance. Accordingly, more will be said about these kinds of practices in subsequent sections. However, three kinds of broad routines of meaning were able to be coded (Table 3.3).


First, it was possible to identify in a general way when the content of letters contained self-identifiers. These were remarks of the kind that could only be made by the writer of the letter, and so performed a function of reinforcing the identity of the sender. In business letters, this often took the form of mentioning other occasions when the writer and receiver had made business deals with each other. Many of the combined personal and business letters became personal because the writer drew on some personal connection or knowledge to establish their identity, and sometimes to try and persuade. The difference in percentages between business letters and mixed personal and business letters for this category is therefore something of an artefact of coding, because mentioning some personal self-identification anecdote or story was one of the key ways of transforming a business into a business and personal letter. Yet, even so, nearly 40 per cent of purely business letters contained some kind of confirmation of personal identity.

Second, writers often referred in one letter to other letters that they had sent or had received. There was often an anxiety about maintaining contact and understanding the sequences of letters. This is perhaps unsurprising given the distance letters travelled and the time they took - as noted already, the Meyrick letters range from just under five to nearly eight months - and the fact that those moving around the colony, either for sightseeing or more likely as they try to find a better position to make a new economic life, may not pick up their letters for some time. One way of establishing communication is to talk about the specific communications that are going on between individuals and groups. It was therefore possible to code letters that made explicit reference to other letters sent and received.

Finally, the most difficult coding exercise undertaken was to identify in letters when writers made clear displays of their personal identity. This is not the use of anecdotes or stories that were tracked in the first category, but the explicit self-exposure of states of emotion, of bodily changes or developments or of ways of expressing the writer's understanding of their life and changes they are coping with. In contrast to telling stories that both writer and reader will recognize as bits of memory that will bind writer and reader together, here it was noticeable on reading letters that many writers were reaching out through the ink by discussing their lives. This is to be expected as, after all, what is a letter for but to keep one's identity in front of the identities of others. Yet, what was looked for here was not the simple recounting of any event, such as a reflection on the weather, on government regulations, current economic conditions and so on, but clear and explicit reflections on a bodily or emotional state of the writer. Despite the obvious difficulty of identifying these clearly, it was such a striking practice, even showing up in a third of business letters, that it seemed worth trying to quantify. The overwhelming numbers of mixed personal and business and personal letters reflect the importance of this practice.

Keeping in mind the difficulty in coding quantitatively some of the phenomena touched on in the tables above, it is still striking that a number of practices can be considered universal across letters. These practices, in their universality, form something like an unthought binding for messages, establishing some of the basic practices that all those involved in these kinds of communicative practices used so commonly as to render them obvious.

This binding consists in a number of elements that establish both the placement of messages and the identity of sender and intended recipient. In terms of stabilizing where the message can be expected to be found, the placement of greeting and farewell are key. Further the greeting establishes who the intended recipient is and accordingly provides clues as to how the writer is expecting the letter to be read. We will see in examples in following case studies how writers shift their form of address and content depending on who the intended recipient is. Similarly, the farewell is universal and provides an identification of the writer, particularly when linked to the signature, and closing the contents. This is marked in some letters which have either a lack or an abundance of things to write about. In the former case, there are blank spaces in the letter making the farewell and signature necessary to tell the reader that the message has ended. In the latter, the normal practice with folded and sealed letters was that only one piece of paper was used but this did not prevent the writer writing on every piece of unexposed paper and then sometimes turning the letter perpendicular and writing over the top of existing writing creating a cross-hatched effect. In these latter cases, the writing can become so confusing that a farewell and signature is essential to identifying where the message finishes and which lines need to be distinguished as having been written at which angle.

Reinforcing these binding and universal practices are a series of other practices which particularly for personal letters ensure the person who is writing is identifying themselves to the readers. While it may seem obvious that individuals will refer to themselves and expose their inner feelings in personal letters, it should not be overlooked that these are done in a context which identifies one person as the writer and which imagines one or more people as the readers. Similarly referring to previous letters, to letters just received, complaining of not receiving letters or warning that few letters will be forthcoming constructs in-between the letters a connection that imagines an ongoing relationship between the writer and his/her readers. Why business letters require less of this most likely relates both to keeping matters away from the personal, and in this sense is partly an artefact of the construction of coding categories, while also gesturing towards business as dispassionate and opening the question of whether business letters reinforce in some way the identifications of writer and reader to compensate for some of the content which is found in personal letters. This latter question will be taken up in the largely business letters of Niel Black.

These routines provide a series of strong binding practices which locate the content of a message as emanating from one body or subjectivity and that the intentions of this body imbue who the letter is directed to, and hence how it is written and to be read. The communicative practice suggests that presence will be created and stabilized based on these material performances, the strong bindings, which create a body and identities for the writer and readers, on the basis of which transmission is made possible. One example is the constant presence of greeting and farewell which frames the message that is to be transmitted, clearly establishing where the writer believes the message starts and finishes and indicating this to the readers. With this practice in place, the message is in part created and meaning may be transmitted. The strong bindings are powerful in their universality and their characteristics are to construct a writer whose fingers have guided the pen's nib and traced the ink on the page; they confirm the body touched the paper that conveys the identity. In this way, a sense of presence between writer and readers can be created which stabilizes communication and produces the moment of transmission, when a reader can take meaning from the page as conveyed by the writer. At the distance of months in time, thousands of miles in space and gulfs of culture between the centuries-old United Kingdom and the years- and decades-old colonial Australia, we find a writer identified as having touched to produce a message whose readers are able to comprehend instantly through stable and binding communicative practices.

While recognizing that what are fundamentally qualitative routines have been quantified and that this must inevitably be somewhat crude, it is striking that various cultures of meaning repeatedly occur in letters in ways that stabilize the identity of a writer and attempt to connect this to the identity or identities of readers. If we take these cultural practices and place them together, as they are in every letter, with the more mute material practices, we already gain a view of communication in which writers and readers are familiar with a range of routines and procedures that can produce simple markers of identity alongside complex enunciations of identity. To begin to draw on this quantitative introduction, it will be useful to see letters as communication in action in three case studies, starting with the remarkable series of letters written by Henry Howard Meyrick from colonial Victoria to his brother, sister and mother in the United Kingdom.

## Henry Howard Meyrick: 1823-47

H. H. Meyrick2 left a series of 24 letters tracing his arrival in Australia in 1840, when he was 17, travelling with one cousin (Alfred) to meet another cousin (Maurice) who was already in Australia and carrying £1,000 in letters of credit. During this time, his letters trace several attempts to set up his own farms, including failure when being swindled out of one 'run' he thought he had bought, having to take a loan from his UK family and finally looking like he was working on a good prospect. He was initially helped by indigenous people who showed him how to make shelters and to eat kangaroos on his first visits to wild land, through to his provision of a clear and unambiguous account of a core controversy in Australian history in the genocide of indigenous peoples as settlers tried to claim land for farms. He died seven years after arriving when pressed to cross a river in full flood on horseback to fetch a doctor for a friend whose wife was in labour; he was swept away and drowned. Horribly and ironically, he had already reported on a similar death only a year before his own, when he wrote of 'Stewart, he was about to cross a swollen river, and to those who tried to dissuade him he answered "I will cross tho I should go to hell on the road" he pushed his horse in, and drowned' (2 August 1846), which with different motivations was what happened to Meyrick (Meyrick, 1939, pp. 228-36).

The following explores the way the strong bindings identified in the previous section played out in Meyrick's letters. For someone like Meyrick there are a range of practices that are universal and that establish the identity of the marks on the page to his body. However, this universality still has to be taught; Meyrick remarks in his third letter that 'Ann will perceive that I have profited by her lesson in the art of folding letters' (20 June 1840). Keeping this strong binding in mind, there are then a number of ways of traversing Meyrick's letters to draw out the communicative practices he is utilizing; there are the forms of greeting and farewell and how they shift; there is the anxiety about letter delivery and keeping sequences; there is the maintenance of the story of the writer; references to mutual acquaintances and there are moments of acute emotions. Across these it should be assumed that the strong bindings are present, as it would be tedious to constantly refer to them. We can now reach into some of the greater complexities that Meyrick's skill as a writer and the survival of a full series of his letters to his family, though not unfortunately of replies to him, allows.

Early greetings and farewells in letters of Meyrick follow a pattern. To his mother he writes to 'My dear mama' and to his brother 'My dear Jim'; in both cases, he closes with 'your affectionate brother' or 'your affectionate son' and signs HHMeyrick. The seventh letter of the sequence to his mother shifts to a simply signed 'Henry; which remains consistent for several letters before reverting to the full signature of HHMeyrick, though at the same time he closes a letter to his sister 'your affectionate brother, Henry' without the full signature. Even later, he begins to simply initial letters to his brother Jim with a closing 'your affectionate brother HHM'. He also returns to using 'Henry' in some letters to his mother. Can much be made of this? Perhaps only that the room for manoeuvre over his name and signature within these communicative practices is highly limited. Were he to sign at any time outside of practices that identify him immediately - for example, is it inconceivable he might have playfully signed 'Lord of the Bush' or some similar? - then the management of any such uncertainty would have to traverse months and miles. Even so, we can imagine that the strength of other bounding routines, like handwriting and conveying news, would be strong enough to cope with some playfulness around the signature, perhaps it was just not Meyrick's way.

A further constant presence in Meyrick's letters is the arrival and non-arrival of letters. He effectively keeps a tally of how often he has written and received and requests confirmation that his letters have been received and of how many have been sent to him. In one exchange, he first complains that 'I think myself a considerably dutiful boy, having written a dozen letters, and only received three' ( 1 November 1840 ), but only ten days later, he is writing a letter to his mother in which he lists a number of new letters he has received asking for confirmation if he has missed any and noting how satisfied he is with the influx 'as it was but a week ago that I was blowing you up for not writing' (11 November 1840). It is a constant of his letters that he mentions what he has received and confirms what he has sent, and keeps them informed if 'I have not written to you for some time inasmuch as I have not lately had the means so to do' (16 May 1841). The anxiety seems to be reciprocated as Meyrick's letters imply that those in England worry over his health and well-being, as is to be expected for many reasons, not least because there are a number of stories of other people's deaths in Meyrick's letter. At one point he replies to his mother:
>I cannot understand how it is that you have received no letters for so long a time, as I have always written regularly, & I do most earnestly beg and beseech you if such a thing should happen again, that you will not fill your mind with such death's head and cross bone visions, for be assured that we shall never take any important step of any sort or kind without first acquainting you of our intention, and if any evil should befall us, we should never think of concealing it for one moment. 
- (18 October 1845)

In Meyrick, it is a routine to ensure communication is asserted in the interstices between letters by constant reference to their travel and arrival, or not. The effect of knowing what has been received and sent is to reinforce and reassert that these subjectivities are who they are. This is closely related to the further practice of updating his story. This is another of those points that seems so obvious that it is a wonder it is worth paying attention to; of course, a son writing from the colonies will tell what he is doing and will do so sequentially leading to a story that is updated. However, like the signature, that something is obvious does not mean it is not also significant, and here Meyrick's identity is constantly updated as he recounts his attempts to start a farm. One example of this, which surely would have been of particular significance to his family in England, is his relationship with his cousin Alfred who came out with Henry on the same boat and were met on arrival in Melbourne by Alfred's brother Maurice. There is initially little mention of Alfred or Maurice until Henry outlines his current farming venture and notes:
>you will observe that there is no sort of partnership between Alfred and
myself, and that if I like to spend my money upon grog it is nothing to him;
we merely let our stock run together, and bear the experience of the station
between us. 
- (20 June 1840)

There then follows across his letters a series of notes about his cousins in Australia, which usually consist of their business relationships that seem to come together and move apart at different times. In this vein, there are notes of when he is in Melbourne picking up goods while his cousin keeps an eye on his run of sheep, or of times he is driving their sheep together or when he · has not had a letter but he expects Alfred has them and he has not seen him for some time. Again the threads, as obvious as they may be, are of a familial identity asserted and established.

The difference in tone of Meyrick's letters also asserts a familial connection because he writes of some different occurrences to his brother and sister in relation to Maurice in Australia. For example, he mentions first to his brother Jim that Maurice has become engaged, which he does not mention to his mother till nearly a month later and there is no other mention to his mother until to his sister he notes:
>What do you think of Maurice and [indecipherable] she has behaved very
ill in the transaction, and was making a fool of him all the time, in order
to bring the other fellow up to [indecipherable] and then she dropped the
country cousin. 
- (15 January 1847)

While these are rather fleeting bits of evidence, it suggests a certain management of his audience when writing. Further evidence in this regard is his constantly upbeat assessment of his prospects to his mother. Even when recounting difficulties, Meyrick always notes how these do not apply to him, and that he has planned well and is doing well. For example, in two successive letters that are two months apart he mentions he has been ill but in both cases he is fine and well again, despite the second letter detailing the same illness as the first and referring to himself as having been reduced to a 'skeleton' (07 January 1841; 20 March 1841). My reading of this upbeat self-presentation was done solely from reading Meyrick's letters; yet a 1939 book written by his nephew, F. J. Meyrick, based on both Meyrick's and some other letters not now available and on family history emphasizes that Meyrick was very sick during these times and had difficulty recovering, something I only realized after reading Meyrick's book despite having read the original letters (Meyrick, 1939, pp. 144- 8). If this is the case, then the constantly upbeat tone of his having just beaten his illness contrasts strongly with a deeply difficult period of illness recounted by F. J. Meyrick and further suggests the management of self-presentation in the letters.

The last evidence of this management of identity is that, in another sequence ofletters, he mentions difficult economic times in Melbourne, but in one letter states he will weather them fine as he has wheat and oats to sell and they will fetch a good price. In a letter some months after, he again mentions the ongoing economic difficulties, even suggesting that unless things change 'the kangaroo will again drink at the Yarra' (25 November 1841), while admitting that wheat and oats did not sell well but now noting he will be fine as he has potatoes (10 September 1841; 21 November 1841). Again F. J. Meyrick's account is one of considerable economic difficulty with the collapse of an economic bubble in Melbourne, leading to extremely difficult times generally (Meyrick, 1939, pp. 156-66).
