# Structures
### Prof. Thomas Streeter

The orgnaizing features of this course relate to structures and feelings. Next week, we will be reading Raymond Williams framework as to how structures and feeling work.

Today, we are going to talk about social structures, very broadly. Social structures
## Overview
- Social Structures: 
we sometimes bump into structures, and they makeup the fabric of our being. It is sometimes, "just the way the world is". 

## What are social structures?
- they are eusive, cannot hold in your hand; nor pick up a social structure, you cannot walk into a social structure like a room or a building. The semi-invisibility is still often the case why people think 'it's all about myself'; people don't like to take responisibility. It is real.
- Social structures require abstraction to understand ("The bird's eye view")
    - John Snow had to do alot of abstraction to figure out the roots of cholera; many decades later the germ theory started to be constructed.
    - In early victorian London, England; it was in part population density. Snow looked at water and sewer infastructure, as well as human interactions with technologies.
    - Generally what we are trying to get at; you may have heard the term "social relations/social formations"
        - Social forces, marxist tradition: relations of production are the driving force of epochs
- Density, relation to landmarks
- Different theories, approaches:
    - Social relations, social forces, modes and relation of production etc.
- Today: inequalities, technologies, cultural forms, and economic systems as social structures.

### Today, we will look at 4 types of social structure:
1. Inequalities
2. Technolgoies
3. Cultural forms
4. Economic systems

## Social inequalities as Structures
- Social inequalities: class, race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality
    - today we still have paste systems, where we are born into our class or societal standing.
- Social class is a thing that is not inherrant in people. We are not born with a licence plate on our forheads that says ``Lower-Middle``
- The best predictor is how much money your parents make when you are a child
- Social mobility is how people are able to move up and down the income scale.
- Teaching in the states, Americans hate that they are a class society, but they are one of the most stratified cultures on earth.
    - statistics show that your parents income is very sticky in the US. It is very rare to move from the bottom 1/5 to the top 1/5th.
    - Canada, however is one of the best at this; due to the relatively equal access to education and social support structures.
        - your parents income is still a good feeler to know how you are going to do.
- Race and ethicity
    - looking at income metrics, in 2013 the median income of worker was between $50-51k/yr. The income for a visibile minority worker was $41k.
    - if someone could look at you and tell you were not white european, your income will be $~5,000 less/yr; if you are indiginous, there is an approximate $10k nower
    - Women get $0.85 on the dollar from men.
    - avg. $0.75; women take the braise of raising children.
    - Social inequalities do not determine everything, but if you look at certain video games, you come to a path where you have extra powers, if you are a white male, you have those extra powers in life.
    - One of the dangers of talking about class this way, we don't only move through life as a(n) white male, asian female, etc.
- Intersectionalities: point at pressures and constraints. You can't be surprised if people use their social identities as sway. 
    - it does excert a force, more like rock in stream than a steal girder.

## Technological Structures

Technology creates structures, communication tech in particular. As a writing technology: feather and ink; the steel nib dipping pen; there was a fine art to sharpening the nib. The steel nib got around quite a few of these issues, as the steel didn't make you stop as often. Later, the fountain pen became popular; the fun of it was chewing the catridges and watching it burst (lol). In the 1800's the typewriter came along, making an error, having to start over. People still talk about pounding out a paper. Voice technologies: Alexander Ghram Bell - Communicating over distance using voice. Before automatic switching: pick up the phone, crank and bell would ring in operator's office. You would then ask "who can i connect you with?". The man that started the automatic switchboard was positive that people were listening to the calls. The rotary phone soon came, then the 'touchtone' phone came along, then in 1990's the cellphone started to break into societal structures, soon to be superceeded by the smartphone.

#### The Telephone
- Each of these technologies have altered how culture is lived. The family dynamic of "SUZIE, IT'S FOR YOU!" people had to interact with eachother and know who they were going to interact with over the phone.
- You could generally figure out who your parents are communicating with over the phone; now you can't tell who they are talking to, unless you are over their shoulder. The den with a closed door, the kids couldn't tell what you were saying. Now this privacy is where you are on a different planet than your parents.
- Technology has impacted how we communicate

#### The Dipping Pen
Prof. Streeter went through some old family boxes, dug out a message from his grandfather in 1895; the family was spread out in generation. He was writing home from college to his mother. In a world of no phones, no cars; 40 miles from home. 40 miles was 2 days hike on foot, or a day on horse. In 1895, the railroad had become a modern form of transportation. One could get from Johnstown to S.... The train ride was becoming a pretty normal thing. Writing a letter started to become a normal form of message transport. 
- People would write down background of their life. You could figure out class; little stoves in college. "the ink is getting thick" (starting to freeze). The ink likely had freezing temp under that of water; starts to apogize for penmanship because of the shivering; penmanship was something tightly rrelated to college.
- goes back to writing on a laterdate, quite common when people would connect their life to others using medium of paper and ink. He wrote differently, oil in lamp was freezing. 
    - signature used to be a way of saying "this is me". 
    - on the back of the signature, PS, PPS, PPPS....
