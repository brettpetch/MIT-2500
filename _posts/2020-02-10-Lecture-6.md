#### Prof. Thomas Streeter

Papers will be handed back on the mid-term exam. This will be multiple choice. Do a quick passthrough of the exam, answer what you know real quick, then try to piece together. If you know the answer to the question and seems to be the correct, just mark it then go back and spend more time with the questions that are more challenging to you
Some people over think and tie their brains in pretzels. The questions will be conceptual. Do all lectures and readings. The lectures are on the readings. Go through the lectures first to get a guide on what you're looking for on the readings. Also, the way this course is organized. Each story has a larger point to technology in society to it. You don't need to remember the dates of CRTC, Kofka, etc. You should be remember: How do the details of the readings extend to a larger point? It's a crucial point in understanding the world. That is a brief overview. Your TAs are available through email or potentially office hours. You can sign up for an office hour on the [booking website](https://tstreete.youcanbook.me/). Don't come in and say "I don't know anything". How many questions? I don't know. Between 50-75. Some will be challenging, others will take some studying to get them right.  One more piece of advice: they test your ability to read like a lawyer instead of a poet. The way poetry often works is through association, in law, it's a kind of use of language to be very comprehensive and precise. When / if any of you have signed a lease, it'll go on for pages. It's tedious, obvious, etc. You have to put down deposit, etc. Each sentence of the lease is worded very carefully so there will be no dispute. Look for words like "always, or, never" and look at "what exactly is the question" rather than what does this remind me of. OK. We are available to help you out; it's still 2 weeks away. Some of you will be doing reading...

NOW: The readings for today are about
# Big Science and the Invention of the Internet
Technology comes from many places, comes form many things. We have learned that technologies do not emerge from single individuals but rather develop in social and historical contexts in social structures. What social structures produce technology? We cannot look at the internet without looking at the centralized, military and government funded projects in the 50's, 60's and 70's. Every time you use your smartphone, you're using them with a military-industrial complex behind them

## Terrifying Tech Success: The Case of the Manhattan Project in WWII

The atom bomb. There was science, alot of people think of einstein and the theory of relativity. There was also a revolution in particle physics. It was thought that atoms were the smallest thing. It was thought that atoms were individual. A number of discoveries lead to the realization that there were sub-particles inside the atom. There was rapid breakthrough in this field. In 1939, two german chemists published an article that they had bombarded a rare element: uranium with neutrons, and there were signs that uranium was broken into atoms of barium. This was proof that you could split the atom through nuclear fission. They realized that a huge amount of energy was released when nuclear fission occoured. This article was passed amongst scientists and physicists were able to discover a chain reaction. If you were able to start this, you would be able to keep bursting other atoms and this would build. For the tiny handful of scientists that did the math, they discovered that it would generate an unfathomable amount of energy. They started to realize this could have applications in many places: eg. BOMBS. In Germany, Hitler had remilitarized germany. They were threatening to invade other parts of Europe. Hungarian-born physcists drafted teh Einstein-Szilard letter, which tried to convince Americans that they should be involved in WWII, the letter mentioned the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type", discussed implications. Enstein signed it because of his fame and he was afraid Nazi Germany might develop such a bomb. This was the start of the Manhattan Project.

September 1st 1939: Germany invades Poland. WWII Begins. In June 28, 1941, Roosevelt created Office of Scientific Research and Development


Enormous concern and energy in weapons development. Between '42-'45, a massive complex research development took place, coordinated across thousands of scientists and engineers involving everything from mining radioactive ores to advances in solid state physics. It employed more than 130,000 people and cost nearly $2 billion USD.

Some historians believe that the bombings in August 1945 the atomi bombs were necessary to end the war. Most historians disagree though.

### What does this have to do with the internet?
Vannevar Bush, who had been overseeing this research project and apparently never slept published "Science, then Endless Frontier". The TL;DR was how do we make advancements during peacetime. The report tried to lay out some basic principals. He was a political conservative, but unlike Einstein, etc. he did not have any issue with the atom bomb. Post-war Einstein: would not have sent letter to Roosevelt in hindsight. Drawing from this experience, Bush argued that private enterprise would not be able to undertake the risks of basic research, so government and non-profits like universities and the military should conduct initial high risk exploratory research, and then turn results over to commerical industry to make practical, and exploit for profit. 
> "There must be a stream of new scientific knowledge to turn the wheels of private and public enterprise"
- Vannevar Bush

His arguement was hugely influential and inspired the creation of US National Science Foundation and has lead to the "military-industrial complex". All of these projects came out of this system (internet, gps, microwave ovens, satellite communications). 

Production of war material takes on its own momentum. Things are made not only for profit, and advancement during peacetime.  A lot of people criticized the military-industrial complex and argued that it created the Vietnam War. Alot of people in ronald reagan's government thought that innovation could run things on its own. It's (military-industrial complex) still there though. 

Before we get into that, you have a famous piece by Vannevar Bush "as we may think". People think he predicted the internet.  Bush realized it was hard to handle large amounts of data. He was worried about how to handle massive amounts of information going forward.

> "There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other works -- conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization become s increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bride between disciplines is correspondingly superficial. Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose."

proposal: create machine to help process vast amounts of data. He did not say computer.

> "Machines with interchangable parts can now be constructed with great economy of effort... Witness the humble typewriter, or the movie camera, or the automobile... A spider web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant grow, in short, the thermionic tube of radio sets, is made by the hundred million..."

How would this machine do this? how would it figure out what to read, etc. We're going to spend some time on this, something important comes out of it.

> "A new symbolism, probably positional"

We need something (not a printer).

> "then beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of logic in every affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register.

What's interesting about this quote is that we some how need to find ways to connect, process, symbolize the connections between information. He wants a machine to do this. The most advanced thing at the time was microfilm. None of this was digital. It was pretty much photo paper. Cameras were getting better all the time and people were discovering photo cells. He wanted to do a combination of this... He keeps thinking of how to do this

> "The human mind... operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by cells of the brain."

> "Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized"

People think that he was desiging web links.

### The Memex

It's funny, he was wrong about how the machine would be built. Vannevar Bush was right at the center of technological development in the west. People were puzzling how to store information outside of the written page.

Now, we've talked about how technologies are developed. There is a specific use in mind, like radio: point to point commmunications across water. In 1945, major institutions were desperately interested in managing information in new ways with machines. 

## Sage and the Origins of Interactive Computing in the Cold War.
How did it become computers. Well, that's why I gave you that chapter on SAGE. To give some background, it's just a window into a much bigger world. I would explain where Thomas Hughes is coming from here. In the late 90's, he was worried that Eisenhower's criticism of the military-industrial complex echoed on both the left and the right missed something. He disagreed. In this book called Rescuing Prometheus sets out what he thinks is the university-military complex. He thought that his is a better way to develop these complex sstems. It's a case study on how big science works. TL;DR: US Government should not be defunding science. 

This is one of those cases where you there are a lot of stories. Try to pull out the patterns: Hughes is looking for how people were arguing. Who is going to own what, but effort into what, etc. BUT: all of these discoveries came out. He's making an argument and doing basic historical research trying to pull out larger details. SO: what was sage really about? 

For a while after WWII, US thought it was only one with atom bomb. Thought that should give to UN, but US was cocky. Shouting match of US and SU, and so people who did military research were looking at what would we do if there was a nuclear war?. There is an answer: once the first bombs go off, we should get rid of them all. People inside the MIC did not see de-nuclearization as an option.

As the war began to get bloodier and bloodier, military was getting worried about faster and feedback to shoot incoming missles. Tracer bullets, radar, gun sights, etc. Humans still in the middle of it. They thought: how do we build feedback loops. After 1945, the military tech development was still there. Each of these made things even faster and more destructive. It made the feedback more difficult to counter. Tech was getting faster than the people on all sides. So: what do we do? Inside most circles, the solution was putting technology. One of these solutions was the [Avro Arrow](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/world/canada/avro-arrow-jet-.html) (CF-105). This company developed a super fast jet airplane with the intention to shoot down bombers. Canada was going to be in the middle of it. They decided to create these in order to shoot down before blown up. They got alot of fanfare, etc. Then Prime Minister: destroyed the Arrow. Much debate over canada getting out of business of war planes. 


### Weiner: Cybernetics and Systems Science

Conceiving of both living and machine processes in systems for complex mechanisms for feedback.
His ideas were taken up inside the military-industrial complex. In creating the first computers, like the ENIAC were designed for complex mathematics by way of batch processing. Your calculator was way more complex than the ENIAC. The idea was : could computers be more dynamic and interactive and used to build interactive feedback systems? 
Well, this is a silent video illustrating how SAGE was supposed to work.

### SAGE
<iframe style="width: 55vw; height: 35vh" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cGqlNUDGLXM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It was conceived in the early 1950s, and was central to the advancement of computing. Before SAGE, you had to do things in binary code, run it, etc. If you were interested in quick responses based on radar detections of soviet bombers, with a traditional computer there would be no time to react. The SAGE system involved multiple computations in conjunction with humans based on the continent. The system as the bombers were coming in: processed in central control centers. A bunch of poor air force guys had to sit at a screen. This was a radical conceptualization of what was coming in on the screen then send out commands to interceptor planes or missiles before they could drop bombs. This is just a model for the new england area. 

Why is Thomas Houghs interested in this technology? He was interested because these organizations, university, militaries cooperated very tightly to build the equipment. The major developments at the time was CORE MEMORY (RAM). They started with little frameworks of wire with beads that could be charged and uncharged for rapid decision making. The idea of interacting with computers through screens rather than switches. They had light pens at the time, where the light could be detected in two directions. THINK STYLUS. The major innovation was the ongoing interaction with a computer rather than walking away. This was a radical new idea and new experience.

Question: So SAGE was never successful? 
Ans: SAGE never had to be used. 

Hugh's Analysis:
> "The sage project presents an unusual example of a university working with the military ofn a large-scale technological project during its design and development, with industry active in a secondary role. SAGE also provides and outstanding instance of system builders synthesizing organizational and technical innovation."

Relation: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth as standards set by groups of companies.

> "The project showed the world how a digital computer could function as a real-time information-processing center for a complex command and control system. SAGE demonstrated that computers could be more than arithmetic calculators, that they could function as automated control centers for industrial as well as military processes."

> "Conventional accounts of the process of invention, research, and development rarely acknowledged the important role played by committees as contrasted with that of individuals. 

> "The designers of the project, now named Whirlwind, quickly began to envision a... "

Hughes doesn't talk about the morality of it all, but he does cooperate with [Lynne Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Conway) to fund more basic research. Conway is famous for developing design methods for silicon chips. Conway was famous for 'designing design methods'.

Conway said on her website as she came out, that became an advocate... Part of what gave her the insight of being the world. Being as a woman: put all the chairs in an electronic circle.

## When computers were women
### Background:
I would like now to talk about the article. Unlike Hughs, she comes out of it with more concern for social structures and hierarchies. Over the past half-century, disciplines are becoming more gender-equal. Computer Science, however has gone the opposite direction. By 2014, 18% of computer scientists are female. In 1984, this stat was 37%. There are problems with computers that originate from the while-male dominance within the industry. So why is there bias on computer scientists? Light's essay has been influential revision of history of computing. She focused on the end of WWII, where one of the first digital computers called the ENIAC. What was going on between gender in the US, for practical reasons women were encouraged to take on jobs that were mostly limited to men. It's what was called "rosie the riveter", men were being enlisted and begin the war. Someone need to 'man' the factories. Light quotes a pamphlet "In this most technical of all wars, science and... Women need to get involved in that". This was about women doing math. There were no digital computers to do these complex math problems. There would be two people doing the math, then 3rd to check both over and make sure no discrepancies. Amount of factories, etc. needed to take into account supersonic trajectories, calculating horizon, etc. There were large large tables given to soldiers. During the war, a computer was a woman doing work in the 1930's/40's. There were lots of women employed doing complicating math problems. Some of the largest equations ever done were done by women (atom bomb calcs). As digital computing started to take hold. Has anyone ever seen a slide-rule?
![Slide Rule](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Slide_rule_cursor.jpg)
<caption>Cursor on a slide rule</caption>

Digital rule, using this stuff we now call binary to do really fast computations. Men will do the hardware, women will have to help out. They brought women over who were computers to help with the development of the ENIAC. This is the story Jennifer Light focused on. She focused on when 'Computer' stopped referring to woman and began referring to a machine. She went into the archives and found out that the 2-3 lead men in ENIAC were backed up by women. This picture she found in the archive. It was not used in the publicity photos. There were massive amounts of wires and switches. These women were doing programming.

In the ENIAC program, they were referred to as teh ENIAC Girls. The women working on this were never listed on technical manuals, papers, etc. Name was never put on it. They weren't in papers, nor in presentations, nor allowed to display their technical knowledge which was essential to career advancement. So after the war, the ENIAC was used to encourage men to sign up for the Army. It was quite a giant sociological shift at the time. And so when the term computer stopped referring to women and instead machines, the 1950's consumer society was pushed aggressively by society (nuclear family, etc.). 

Question: Much of the video games made today are made by men, why is this still going on today? Let me ask you? Does it make sense to you?

Ans: I think that the societal rules that were entrenched during the 1950's is still engrained in society today. 

Ans: Women are told they have to work harder to get what they want. 

## The Internet and Nuclear War
This is a bit of a story on how the internet actually works. Centralized networks: Picking up the phone, operator would plug into the other person's phone. You'd have a constant wired connection to others. After that, communications systems became decentralized. Long distance calling: picking up the phone of calling someone in Calgary or California (from London, ON) you'd still have to be at one node, then get connected to another switching node until it 'hopped' to where you needed to talk to. In the 50's and 60's, people who were really scared of Nuclear War, the people realized if a bomb fell on any of the nodes, communication would cease. For military, the bomb going off would shatter the ability to relay communications. In the 1960's, computer scientists proposed a distributed network. If one node went out, there would still be a way of communication. The question was: HOW DO YOU BUILD THAT?

Someone said "what if we digitize everything" Packet switching... Equally sized small points, would find its own way to the destination. I reccomend video: [Internet Infastructure As Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n71TUnTNdw8), Linus Tech Tips: Techquickie YouTube. The idea of this is TCP/IP. TCP/IP is what the internet uses. 32 bits is layed out this way: IP Header; then TCP is the source, destination, sequence, checksum, all this stuff then a little bit of data. When you watch game of thrones, there are millions of packets flying around and landing on your computer and being turned into dragons on your screen. It seems completely rupe goldberg. 

The development of this idea was funded based on the fact it (the internet) could survive a nuclear war.
