## Essay 2: March 16th - 900-1000 words.
Show how:
1. Technology empowers ordinary people against central forces or 
2. Disempowers ordinary people against central forces. 

Use empirical evidence and theoretical arguments from at least 2 readings, up to 4 readings (from course). 

Last essay, you did a solid job of summarizing the article, however the argument of the critique was not done as well. Actually capturing what an author is trying to do and how they're making their argument, etc. exactly how they are making it: evidence, how it carries them along to a certain conclusion. That's really hard to capture. Put what the other person says, make it available and reference it to the reader: they said this, but why did they say it that way.

> Question: Is it going to be graded the same way?
- 3 out of ten seems limited.

I grade on a bell-curve. It doesn't go straight to a 100 points scale. You assign different points... It's the same as if we are giving out letter grades, I will talk to the TAs on how to grade subsequent essay. I guess bell-curves are not all that common at Western. For an intstructor like me, if I were to be expected; I could be easy or hard. I want to compare people to others in this class rather than some place else. If you have questions about your grade, then you can talk to your TA, then if you have talked to your TA and still have questions you can [Set Office Hours with Streeter](https://tstreete.youcanbook.me/). I think for this, the idea of this is not the same structure assignment, we will kind of work out a very fair way of grading it that keeps things consistant with your fellow FIMS students basically. Any other questions about that assignment?

``` we're over it ```

I cannot extend the final essay, it's against Western's policy. Plan to allocate your time. March 16, you can turn it in before this date.

## Amateurs, Hackers and Countercultures.
We have talked about what corporations want to do with technologies, we are going to talk about how these technologies get to be used by everyone. Last week, we talked about Big technology, big science and the effort to control from centers of power inside of the military-industrial complex and how corportate uses of computers for control (ie, banking, billing, manufacturing). 

Computers outside the complex started to use computers that needed to keep track of large numbers and look at them. It was worth the money in 1960's for banks to spend a ton of money. Alot of this had alot to do with the creation of the internet, but other things got in the way, and how technologies serve as occasions for rebellion, for the discovery of new uses. While today focuses on electronic communication: movable type printnig in 1482: printing bibles; make people more religious. Make people respect late-midevil catholocism today. You have have been through this in History of Communication. At this point, ordinary people could read them and it took away some of the mythicism of the bible. When people said "this is god's word", you were inclined to believe them. Once you translated to your main language, you could interperate the bible differently; the prodistant reformation. Many countries, people rebelled against the catholic church, came up with their own religion. By the 1600's Europe was torn to pieces from war and battle. Some of the worst areas: endless civil war, europe when 

1. new technologies change the status-quo
2. Not always happy. Very few revolutions are not violent.

### Amateurs: Radio
The first uses of radio communication, by marconi, etc. was mostly people wanted to use it for existing purposes. The navies of the world all wanted to communicate with ships at sea. So, Susan Douglas' book is a very important piece in radio broadcasting, and the core of her argument is that after radio amateurs entered the field, 
> "For the first time in america, [people] were being invisibly bound together by and in the airwaves, not by necessity, but for fun, to lear from and establish contact with others"

As an aside, about reading that quote is from very near the end of her chapter. She is a beautiful social historian. She does have arguments, but you do have to read carefully. Just as a heads up, this is right on the last page of that chapter for you. That kind of captures what she is most interested in in that chapter. What her book as a whole is famous for, and did so effectively was it make the case that radio broadcasting was a socially constructed institution. (Raymond Williams). She had read Raymond Williams, but she carefully worked out the process of sending signals over the air, and people using receiving only. She looked at "how did that happen?" 

Question: I thought that the first information in broadcasting: nazi tv; she's talking about early 20th century, 1906-1922*(5), the nazis were the first to use television on a broadcast basis. She's writing about sound only, no picture. 

These are variations on slides from earlier.

#### Scientific Discovery: Radio
ca. 1860, James Clerk Maxwell predicts the existence of electromagnetic waves.

1888m Hertz proves theory using the spark-gap apparatus. 

#### Practical Uses for Established Purposes.
We want to do x but we want to do it better: people were already using wired-telegraphs to fight wars, communicate across continents, etc. Stumbling trying to wire all of the telegraph. They called it the "Wireless telegraph". The 'Bill Gates' of the technology was Marconi "Imperial Wireless Scheme". Told the countries: "I got what you need". WWI, got in on the game, RCA was created after WWI. Westinghouse and GE were early electrical device manufacturers. Figure it out and make money from it.

New purpose: sending signals in all directions. Issue: controlling corporation, fighting wars: omnidirectionality was something we overcome from using the 1st generation of the radio. Very cheap hobbiest radio sets. People started playing around with this gadgetry, and began to find new things to do with it. This is why I like to call radio amateurs the hackers of the early 20th century. 

Show and Tell With Streeter:

[The Boy Electricity by Alfred P. Morgan](https://www.americanradiohistory.com/BOOKSHELF-ARH/A.P.Morgan/The-Boy-Electrician-2-Morgan.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A475%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22Fit%22%7D%5D) pg. 157: paging through and seeing how an ordinary kid could build cool electronic gadgetry. Because it was called the boy electrician... A 20 year old, doing all this cool stuff: really celebrating how amazing this was: November 3, 1907: New wonders of wireless

#### Douglas on Willenborg
Willenborg, an otherwise ordinary young man, had become a celebrity through mechanical tinkering. He told the reporter that he expected to be exchanging messages with Paris and Berlin within a month. He claimed that the message couldn't be detected, nor interfered with. The newspaper article's author wrote this as an "o my god cool" rather than being sceptical.

This was a gradual redefinition of what it meant to be a man, particularly white, middle class in america.... culture gives different answers in different times and locations. Telling people before, like in the 1890's, you were told that you were to be well-built, be like Teddy Roosevelt. Strong, etc. Hard to work as a man at a desk. In folklore, mounties catching bad guys, etc. this was a very rugged idea of how men were supposed to be. Now: master technology > wilderness.

We've talked about how women were computers, when you define an activity as masculine, you are excluding other people, like women. This celebration of white, middle class identity.  

This is what they called a diode. In the upper right, you could tune your radio to different frequencies with a slider on it. **Crystal Set Kits** had to ensure that it didn't short out. Quaker oats was one of the emerging: Round boxes were good to build coils out of. Here you could get a whole kit for $1, (~$15.36 USD today).

The most dramatic example of this example is the Tom Swift: Young adventurer. In those days, motorcycles were quite exotic technologies. In each book, he'd start out with some cool gadgets. More common to see airships / blimp. One of the most famous of the books was [Tom Swift and his Wireless Message](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227). (save the day gets the girl in the end). We think of electricity as hydro. It's so mundane. People were reading these stories throughout the culture. 

#### Step 4: Conflicitng Visions
Douglas does a great job of explaining the conflicting ideas. This is one of the things that Douglas rediscovered. They created a formal relay system to serve all amateurs. This was mostly happening with dots and dashes rather than with sound and microphones. They discovered you could relay signals between one amateur and another, then another, etc. Created the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). It was a grass roots coast-to-coast communications network. Wireless telegraphy created a way to people to do an 'indie' way of doing things. This was ordinary folks 'just doing it'. The ARRL: there was a flood - helped organize rescue efforts, reported news of elections before newspapers could, etc. So, they were remarkably successful. Their idea was using the radio as a public participatory activity.

The Navy wanted to keep the airwaves closed and under their control. There were some amateurs that sent navy ships on quests, rescues, etc. Increasingly, as big corporations; this was the first generation of big corporations; ie ATT (Bell), etc. being created as national corporations. They wanted privileged access (build marketplace exchanges of various kinds) three deeply-conflicting ideas of what should be done with this thing called radio.

During WWI, governments took over (declared) they needed to control airwaves during war time, where radio the war becomes good for technological development. Told the corporations that you must cooperate. Sharing technology to advance the system. The Amateurs were often drafted or enlisted; were able to learn more about radio how to make work better while at war in europe. As horrible as WWI were, they came out with radio working better, more people knowing how to use and make it work. And so, war was over in 1918, people come home and begin playing around with radio. Westinghouse applied for government licensing to broadcast commercially. 

Everyone is two-way, but sometimes people would develop a lot of listeners. Sound transmission started to become possible. People would play records. People would be able to hear music over this weird gizmo. It was more about how far away it was coming from rather than just that music was coming over it. There was a radio amateur that went into WWI, hired by westinghouse corporation; said "why don't we use this radio stuff on a broader basis... set up transmission of interesting stuff". Create way to sell more radio sets. Westinghouse said we want a licence to do this thing we're doing, called broadcasting. As usually with court cases, the US government decided with help of courts: were not sure iif people were allowed to broadcast, no channel allocation. The lines got blurry, universities started to play with it, no legal basis: you have to broadcast on this channel. People started to interfere with each other. People wanting to drown out competitors, 1921-1925: Chaos on the airwaves. The big businesses went to the (US) government and said "we need regulation". It's also not insignificant. A lot of the market was being flooded with radio: radio stocks: everyone is going to get rich, bubble popped in 1927, put us and most of the west another 20 years to crawl out of. This was the creation of the BBC, and in Canada, the US signals in Canada: to the dismay of the Canadian Government, in 1928 the Canadian Royal Commission on Broadcasting. Made sure that content was somewhere in the middle. What was happening during this period was that there was this moment of experimentation, people trying all sorts of new things and the government trying to assert a new order.

In Europe, a lot of companies were overcoming WWI.

### Technology in the 1960's Counter Culture (~1965-1972)

Some of you may have heard of the failed revolutions in europe. many efforts to overthrow the kings, queens feutal lords, the year that music and everything changed. What people at the time reported was that culture changed after 1848. There were stories that "i heard about the rebellions in paris, etc. beethoven walking through the park, refused to bow, etc. Just marched through them. 1848 were where those small cultural rebellions started. Even though the revolutions failed.

1960's counter culture it was a similar period of changes in the cultural period of things. Your lives are all part of this. You live in dorms without curfews. Their sex lives are their own responsibility. You listen to music that has obscene language in it. None of this was considered ok before the counter culture. A lot of people talk about how haircuts changed. It was considered appalling. I think that the Beadles were starting to imitate their audience at that point. People also talk about the vietnam war. People thought "it must be right, we've got to fight communism" the US government started to regularly over-promise what they were going to take. If you were in college in 1965, you had to worry about being drafted and sent to Vietnam. The number of deaths were growing monthly. It brought a lot of scepticism about the vietnam war. If the government screws up on one thing, you have to start to wonder what else they are bullshitting. 

It's also important that the counter culture started in the middle class. The world was becoming unravelled by the vietnam war. Idea of wanting a life that was meaningful and with moral. It's complicated in how this developed. Nationwide strikes that overthrew government, mexico: major demonstrations (slaughter of college students in atrocity that is still covered up). In the eastern block the Prauge Spring, in Czech... prague... there was an opening up of the totalitarianism in the world. It was première of free speech, etc. I have a friend that was a German Hippie, he got to Czech republic, beatles, etc. all seemed so fantastic. changed his life. In his case, as he was leaving he was going to make a stop in Hungary where the soviet tanks overthrew, had a hair-raising couple of weeks / days trying to get home. Said "i'm getting out of here" risked his life, swam down the alba and crawled up on shore in germany. It's not like he had a political philosophy, but rather a feeling of openness. He had this feeling and wanted more of it.  

Now, the US Counterculture spread on all accounts, addressed issues in all kinds of contrary ways. The Sexual revolution "good women" were allowed a certain amount of autonomy.

This is all background. Now let me introduce

### Whole Earth Catalogue

See [Whole Earth Catalogue](https://archive.org/details/B-001-013-719/)

Colour photography and shiny magazines were often the norm. Done in a kind of improvisatory way, gave access to tools, don't have to be subject to corporations. Instructions for various kinds of farming, instructions for raising goats, open curiosity to it. Elaborate do it yourself ethos to it. It was where I learned how astronauts went to the bathroom in space. This was something that sat on nightstands, bookshelves, etc. Idea that information should be accessible. Tech was seen as Nuclear weapons. 

![IBM 360](https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_19/432091/140509-ibm-360-mn-1120_389febddf130d37b7293f5406ad49307.fit-2000w.jpg)

The counterculture and the Whole Earth Catalogues went hand in hand. It was against "high tech", giant corporate kinds of things, it was almost like it was against computers. The dominant idea of computers in those days was that they were big science. They were that stuff associated with nuclear wars. When asked why don't we build little computers that people could have in their home. The dominant look is the IBM 360, which cost nearly as much as a Boeing 737. Few people were allowed in the room, it worked by tapes, it was big centralizing effort. It could do such smart things like ordinary people.

HAL decides that the astronauts endanger the mission and HAL starts to bop off the astronauts one-by-one. OK. you'll have to watch the movie to see what happens, but it's a futuristic computer. Irritatingly even rational voice, and it's murderous, doesn't care about people. Alot of the computer, what people were trying to do with computers implied that model. As computers began to get cheaper, they realized that maybe they can be used outside insitutions, mainly in secretarial work. There were complaints from corperate executives. They're all listening to this Women's Lib stuff (Feminism). People starting to realize people didn't want to sit all day, rather than trying it out and pressing send rather than getting up and delivering it somewhere. Questions / comments?

Have any of you heard the phrase Insturmental Rationality? No? Kind of rationality that is directed about to efficiency and control. Everything is a tool. Things to be predictable and regularized. Reducing human interaction, thought to be a good thing.

Alot of the counter culture: do not fold / bend / spindle or mutilate. The dominant way of interacting with computers, what you do is produce programs on punchcards. They became part of everyday life. Always said do not fold, spindle or mutitlate.

Stuart Bran, Manning camera at a demonstration in 1968... Engalbart: 

<iframe style="width: 55vw; height: 45vh;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yJDv-zdhzMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

What he is doing is manipulating words on a screen. He had a mouse, other gizmos for moving things around on the screen. It wasn't just a screen. He said lets treat this as an experience rather than starting from instrumental rationality.

### Brand's Spacewar (1972)
Thought "maybe computers don't have to be giant institutional evil devices. The article from Brand appeared in Rolling Stone magazine, when it was a mouth piece for counter cultural rock music. Kind of a flagship in the counter culture in some ways. Alternative ways of viewing things, where one article framed computers completely differently. This is a totally different way of experincing computers. It was a about as straight as hotrodders would look. This was considered to be a countercultural activity... Turning a VW Bug and turning it into a dune buggy.

First thought of the computer outside of the... In computing, it was about being creative, about being an artisan. People are willing to pay you if you're good and there is plenty of time to screw around. This is quite the opposite of the HAL 9000 envisioning of how it was supposed to be. The countercultural trends started to develop fans and spread in the 1970s. A lot of this stuff was printed. Phrase user-friendly. 

![Processed World covers](https://cdn-ed.versobooks.com/blog_posts/000003/372/processed_world_cover-.jpg)

In the 70's this was black and white, "Byte", this is a picture of Spawk from Star Treck, pictures sign "computers in every home". People saying we have a different idea of how to do computers.

Book called ["Computer"](http://worrydream.com/refs/Nelson-ComputerLibDreamMachines1975.pdf), everything inverts, then the book is another side. Hand published, black powerraised fist. The theme that computers can set you free; goes through all of the alternative ways of using computers. About screens, etc. Direct computing. It's about a way of being creative. 

### Ted Nelson's Influence:
Microchips were getting cheaper, some serious computing power in a box began to become more and more important. Jobs and Woz, etc. People starting selling things to eachother, Gates started selling a computer language called BASIC to computer hobbiests. Become celebrations of individual geniuses. One of the best books about Silcon Valley is called Accidental Empire. All of these thnigs being stumbled onto this. The ones who are famous now are hose that made piles of money from it. SJ was an impersario, infamous bully, etc. People who design all of these things who come out of this culture, but didn't manage to be at teh top of a corporation. Focus on the broader picture: it came out of a culture and a vision. It is created according to specific visions. Not just springing from the mind of individual geniuses. Ted Nelson made next to no money from it. That's how technological developments happen. 

The Apple II, etc. were some of the first microcomputers. Hobbiest computer companies quickly figured out that they could make millions of dollars selling microcomputing units to businesses. IBM had to completely re-adjust how they do buisness. They became typewriters on steroids, places to send / receive email. Industrial empires were founded, HP, other companies moved into the same area. Became... The aura / thrill started to ware off. The fascination of computers became mundane and changed things in quite interesting ways... Just becoming another business machine. Gates: buy OS, cheap, then jack up the price. Gates was soon a rich person that was established through monopoly. One of the technological things about the computer: You buy, you plug in printer, you're done. What they weren't was networked. People could login to bulletin board websites, it was slow and not interconnected. 
Microcomputers had become boring, but by 1992, people were trying to find the next way. 

Realization was interconnected computers for communication (in cool new ways). There had been studys and research DARPA, some of the stuff that we've been talking about. The microcomputing industry was ign. WIRED: founder wanted to apply the ethos to the computer network. had essays of why cable tv was not the way of the future. Laurie Anderson, the famous musician online sex... they were all over it. WIRED started poking around at the existing industry. realized that they needed to figure out how do we control intellectual property. ["Everything you know about intellectual property is wrong"](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/) by John Perry Barlow. People who had access to internet at that point outside of research institutions, etc.

The internet Browser: The Golden Geeks Feb 19, 1996 The 1990's Stock Bubble 1994-2001. Marc Andreessen: Netscape

What we're creating is an information highway. It's a superhighway because it's fast. "I want to go between A & B" usually just to drive, unless you're in LA, which I can't explain...

##### ASIDE (brett)

### Internet, pornography, etc. 

Decided to do a corporate IPO (company that has no profit model, is giving away it's product). Instead, they raised more money, broke records and became rich overnight. It set off what I think is still the largest stock bubble in human history. Money started pouring into netscape and created a bubble. Other companies started to do the same. Yahoo! still exists, but alot of these companies were in the DOT COM bubble.

hope taht companies will settle in and start doing it (making money). It is still a common way of investing, particularly in the US. That was created in teh 1990's around marc andreessen, kept building more internet pipes. When you were children the internet worked very well because they had spent so much money on internet infrastructure. 

Moral of the story: Both the micro-computer in alot of ways mirrored the development of broadcasting on the radio. Framed as rebellious, and institutionally over time there is a kind of re-configuration of new uses for the technologies that then start to congeil. When Zuckerburg dropped out of college in ~2002 and went to form a company based off of a piece of software he originally wrote.

see: THE SOCIAL NETWORK (Docu-Drama on Zuck's life)

Zuckerburg going to VC meeting in his pyjamas, says "I don't want your money", following the script by that point. Walked out, they come walking and keep trying to give him money, establishes standard.

##### Unrelated Meme to help make sense of the script:
<iframe style="width: 55vw; height: 45vh;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N6Zz-Nkkaxc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Not going to go through the whole way that social media arose, but there is a cycle. Now, it's still going on, etc. Where's the innovation?

People around Shenzhen, China: start making things, sporting tone where they like to drink beers and talk about what it is that they invented. There are shopping malls in parts of china where you can find things like a cell-phone razor combo. Cigarette case, other side = cellphone. This is all really cheap things.

People will play with, mess around with, etc. technology.

### The Dialetics of Control and Rebellion:
Individualist rebellions are typically at best contradictory, tech matter and are never enough on their own to create democracy
- Arab Spring (Twitter Revolution)
- Internet Democracy in the US

You see many dissapointments. We will talk about Arab Spring at length later in the course. People thought it was because they could get together on Twitter. 

Then: 2016 happened, Brexit, Trump, these moments of cultural change, rebellion, they real, they matter, they will happen again, and are not themselves enough to make change. 

Dialectics: part of how modern industrial societies adjust to change, or not wanting to change too much.
