## Intro
Pictures of culture, language. Prehaps Raymond Williams would like something like that... Just as a reminder, there is a writing assignment due Feb 3rd. Midterm on the 24th. If you have any questions while you're working on it, contact them soon. There is also a midterm exam on Feb 24th, and the makeups will be scheduled on Saturday mornings. 


Today, the topic is What is Technology anyway? For a show and tell today, I brought in a gizmo, a thing you can type text into.

There were variations of it releasing products between 1993-2013. It was discontinued. It takes a couple AA batteries and it runs for months. It was built for teaching writing skills in k-12 classrooms. It is pretty indestructable, light, cheap and all it does is write. There's no Facebooking, coloured images, none of that distraction that comes to us with out laptops and microcomputers. Part of how I discovered this is alot of Journalists and people that write for a living buy them for ~$50 on eBay. You just write. If you're a reporter or writing a novel, this is a good choice. This is just a slightly different packaging of the same technologies were in our laptops. One of the questions we're going to be talking about is: this is a world not travelled. Maybe it would be better for us to be using thse instead of our colour screen laptops. This is an example of an alternate packaging of technology. This isn't impracticle, it has a second life and people are buying them. It doesn't crash, it's quite reliable. 

## The Evolution of the Touchscreen
No, Apple did not create the multi-touch screen. The truth of Technological evolution is that it's gradual and social. Technology is almost never the product of one person or one lab. It's something that happens amongst human beings talking, thinking, tinkering over long periods of time. Radar was developed in WWII, partly by accident. One of the things radar was the first of was that it was a siloscope. People had to figure out how to interact with a screen that shows little sine waves. How do we interact with it? 

### 1965: The First Touch Screen
1965: 1965 Eric Arthur Johnson, RRE put various wires on the screen to touch to interact with the screen. Brent Stumpe worked for CERN, tasked with building equipment to do nuclear research. The poliferation of knobs and buttons became more and more. 

### 1972: Capacitive Touchscreen
He then created the **Capactive Touch Screen**, where it came from within CERN. He may not have known about Johnson, but eventually the PLATO educational computer system in the University of Illinois. In 1972, this was a radical idea. The computer was originally for banks, government and national security. Computers with images coming alive on the screen. The last one of these was unplugged in ~2003. Part of what happened is another road not traveled. When microcomputers started coming about, it was mostly just a single keyboard you interacted with. Then the mouse emerged in the 1980's. 

### 1969: The Mouse
The first version of the mouse was invented in 1969 by a researcher working for Xerox. For the 80's and 90's, the way people interacted with computers was the mouse and the touchpad. Mice were big at the time, used alot of power. The trackpad emerged in the 90's as a low-powered solution. 

### 1990: The CRT Touchscreen (for consumers)
So, here's a video from 1990 with a CRT touchscreen. [YouTube: The Touchscreen](https://youtu.be/QEZEVy6aIww?t=43). 

### 1999: Fingerworks
John Eloas and Wayne Westerman: People inside Apple that got interested in making computers that worked with touch. They knew other people were doing it, then shut down one of their accusitions, Fingerworks. The author of the reading was interviewed about Wayne Weterman.

## So How Shoudld we theoroize Technological Evolution? Raymond Williams' Critique of MccLuhan?
Everything is related to everything else, but so what, how does it help us with understanding the world?
In Williams' way, he was thinking about television. Alot of you probably know that Marshall McLuhan was very interested in Television. McLuhan said it's not what's on TV, but the TV itself that's changing life. From this, McLuhan introduced the idea that the Medium is the Message. He became famous for saying more and more cryptic things. Raymond Williams was instead interested in culture. He got a visiting position in the US (Stanford) and looked at how we talk about how technology is understood. In his words, he said 
> "it is often said that the television  has altered our world... But this may be the centeral difficulty: that we have got so used to statements of this general kind, in our most ordinary discussions, that we can fail to realize their specific meanings."

From this, we need to look at is the iPhone changing everything. Is it the question of the iPhone at hand? the form or the content? It's not just an analytical question, depending on how you answer it, it changes what you're going to do about it. Using social life. That understanding is going to shape what is going to be done. It's not just about analysis, but acting in the world. Now, Williams in this passage or this part of the chapter, describes two common forms / habits of thinking about technology. 
### 1. Technological Determinism
was embraced by Marshall McLuhan in "The Medium is the Message". This basically said that technology pops out of a lab somewhere, then sets the condition for social change and progress... For example, the steam engine, the automobile, the atomic bomb, havve made modern man and the modern condition.

If you look at the Big Bang Theory intro, it's a comedic view on the evolution of technologies. I'm not saying that the creators of "The Big Bang Theory" are technological determinists. It's implying various forms of technological determinism without being specific about what's causing what. There are two strains, Symptomatic technology and Technological Determinism.

### 2. Symptomatic technology: 
> "Acknowledges other causal factors in social change [eg. captialism]. It then considers particular technologies, or a complex of technologies, as ymptoms of change of some other kind."

There are several ways to look at technology. Read it through the lens of something symptomatic of that technology. It reads technology as symptoms of other kinds of change.

### 3. Raymond Williams understanding of technology:
> "Each position, thouhg in different way, has abstracted technology from society"
- Raymond Williams

Audience Question: Would you say that these are in opposition between Technological Determinsim and Symptomatic Technology?
- No. They have an understanding of eachother.

## A Case Study of Technology in Society, Early Radio Broadcasting
The story of how radio came to be for this thing we call "broadcasting" -- the sending of one-way radio signals throuhg the air to large numbers of receiving sets -- is an interesting illustration of the interaction of new technologies with social forces. 

The question is why is there so much one-way use of radio technology instead of something like the telephone? Instead, broadcasting took over this idea of communication and became a centeral feature. It defined the nation, as Canada was deeply shaped by TV and Radio Broacasting ([CBC](https://cbc.ca/)). 

### Step 1: Scientific Discovery
The pony express: way of getting mail between the East and West coast of the US. There was a desire to pull everything into one society. The pony express was a very expensive way of getting mail across the country. There were young men, grab the mail bag, then gallop for several hours until the horse was nearly at exhaustion. Whenever the rider became exhausted, another man would be swapped out. There was an issue with mail disappearing. The pony express only lasted ~ 1 year, until a railroad was formed. 

Getting back to Radio waves, people love communicating farther than they can shout. The romans had runners. There were people taught how to use semaphors, spell out letters with flags and use binoculars to pick out the message from a distance. James Clerk Maxwell predicts the existence exlectromagnetic waves. James Clerk Maxwell was a scientist that came up with Maxwell's equations. What they do is that there should be electromagnetic waves. If each moving magnetic field creates an electric field. He created a math to explain why this was the case. They discovered that there were weird signals through the air. It wasn't until 1888, a german philosopher (Heinrich Hertz) set out to prove the theory of sending electromagnetic fields throgh the air. He came up with a Spark-Gap Apparatus (fig. 1)

### Step 2: Practical uses 
1895-1910: Radio as a point-to-point wireless telegraph: of interest to Navies, imperial powers, and corporations. Maracroni "Imperial Wireless Scheme", WWI, RCA, Westinghouse, and General Electric.

Moving Bananas: The fruit corperation needed this kind of technology. It brought particular kinds of power to play, control at a distance. They imagined that as they approached a new technology.  

There was an Italian born man named Marconi, with all of this in mind, he got alot of credit during his lifetime for radio. He discovered grounding. He was trying to communicate on his estate. Realized that if he dropped a wire, it would have better signal. He soon discovered that he could create a wireless signal. The Imperial Wireless scheme had operators on ships, as well as at land. The Titanic had one of these operators. The Marconi Telegraph operator, in New York that intercepted this and soon founded the CBS Media Empire. In 1912, it was just the morning of the Titanic going down, but because of the telegraph, there was fast transmission of this information. They were still using spark gaps. People needed to wear rubber gloves, etc. to prevent getting a good jolt. All transmitted via sparks over great distance. In WWI, this form of communication was saught after to communicate. One of the dirty secrets of technological communication is that war expediates the process. There is a variety of interests, such as commercial interests, controlling empire, and for military. Also happening, electric lights were created, and the telephone was being invented. In the US, these companies decided that if there was alot of equipment needed to make this work, then there is a need for someone to manufacture it (on an industrial scale). 

### Step 3: The discovery of a new purpose - Broadcasting
There was a problem with radio technology, where it was not directional. The need for point-to-point communications was very important. **How do we get signals under control?** In 1906, the crystal detector was discovered. The beginning of solid state physics. You could take a little wire, then place it on a rock. You could then easily receive and transmit radio signals. This costed only $6. This thing, the crystal detector meant that ordinary people could manufacture their own or buy their own detector. This brought reach to hobbiests and ordinary people. This became the Amateur Radio movement. Radio amateurs liked omnidirectionality, and they'd stay up late at night and get signals from hundreds to thousands of miles away. The ability for everyone to hear the radio signals was a good thing. It was cheap enough that people could do it for a hobby. A direct descendant of this was the HAM radio. 

### Step 4: Conflicting Visions
Famously, amateurs began getting really good at the technology. They were better than Marconi's operators. They began to have issues with the Navy, wherein there were security issues and people routing ship into random places on the group. In the states, they created the American Radio Relay Leauge (ARLL): open public airwaves. The Navy wanted closed airwaves. There was soon the idea of sending news, music, etc. over radio waves. The corperations were weiry of the Navy, Decided that they needed some kind of radio. In WWI, there was a government takeover of radio, which forced corperations and ARLL to stop communications. Radio amatures were often drafted as radio operators. The corperations all had to cooperate, so the technology actually advanced. All of these powerful interests were now up in arms as to where radio technology was to be headed. The term broadcasting hadn't yet settled into the home. I

### Resolution: The Corporate Model
In 1919, everyone started to broadcast informal, network-style communications. Later, in 1920, Westinghouse applied for government licence to boradcast commerically. Wanted to be able to sell in stores, like a hardware store. It wasn't quite clear what powers the US had to keep the airwaves in order. In 1921, there were people who began to have issues, where they couldn't be kicked off the air. If you wanted to be heard, you would crank up your transmitter and someone could drown you out. By 1925, the quality and experience was going down. There was alot of interference. In 1927, the government had to regulate in public interest. The modern radio system began to emerge. Big buisnesses were given licences, etc. all needed was figure out how to pay for it. The CBC is partially government supported, partially advertising. Moral of the story is what we call radio broadcasting. If you have a TV set in your living room, etc. That is not two way, etc. Is not defined by technology but instead by confluence. That's what made it what we now call broadcasting.
