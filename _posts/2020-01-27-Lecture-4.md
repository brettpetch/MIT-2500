## Intro
Pictures of culture, language. Prehaps Raymond Williams would like something like that... Just as a reminder, there is a writing assignment due Feb 3rd. Midterm on the 24th. If you have any questions while you're working on it, contact them soon. There is also a midterm exam on Feb 24th, and the makeups will be scheduled on Saturday mornings. 


Today, the topic is What is Technology anyway? For a show and tell today, I brought in a gizmo, a thing you can type text into.

There were variations of it releasing products between 1993-2013. It was discontinued. It takes a couple AA batteries and it runs for months. It was built for teaching writing skills in k-12 classrooms. It is pretty indestructable, light, cheap and all it does is write. There's no Facebooking, coloured images, none of that distraction that comes to us with out laptops and microcomputers. Part of how I discovered this is alot of Journalists and people that write for a living buy them for ~$50 on eBay. You just write. If you're a reporter or writing a novel, this is a good choice. This is just a slightly different packaging of the same technologies were in our laptops. One of the questions we're going to be talking about is: this is a world not travelled. Maybe it would be better for us to be using thse instead of our colour screen laptops. This is an example of an alternate packaging of technology. This isn't impracticle, it has a second life and people are buying them. It doesn't crash, it's quite reliable. 

## The Evolution of the Touchscreen
No, Apple did not create the multi-touch screen. The truth of Technological evolution is that it's gradual and social. Technology is almost never the product of one person or one lab. It's something that happens amongst human beings talking, thinking, tinkering over long periods of time. Radar was developed in WWII, partly by accident. One of the things radar was the first of was that it was a siloscope. People had to figure out how to interact with a screen that shows little sine waves. How do we interact with it? 

### 1965: The First Touch Screen
1965: 1965 Eric Arthur Johnson, RRE put various wires on the screen to touch to interact with the screen. Brent Stumpe worked for CERN, tasked with building equipment to do nuclear research. The poliferation of knobs and buttons became more and more. 

### 1972: Capacitive Touchscreen
He then created the **Capactive Touch Screen**, where it came from within CERN. He may not have known about Johnson, but eventually the PLATO educational computer system in the University of Illinois. In 1972, this was a radical idea. The computer was originally for banks, government and national security. Computers with images coming alive on the screen. The last one of these was unplugged in ~2003. Part of what happened is another road not traveled. When microcomputers started coming about, it was mostly just a single keyboard you interacted with. Then the mouse emerged in the 1980's. 

### 1969: The Mouse
The first version of the mouse was invented in 1969 by a researcher working for Xerox. For the 80's and 90's, the way people interacted with computers was the mouse and the touchpad. Mice were big at the time, used alot of power. The trackpad emerged in the 90's as a low-powered solution. 

### 1990: The CRT Touchscreen (for consumers)
So, here's a video from 1990 with a CRT touchscreen. [YouTube: The Touchscreen](https://youtu.be/QEZEVy6aIww?t=43). 

### 1999: Fingerworks
John Eloas and Wayne Westerman: People inside Apple that got interested in making computers that worked with touch. They knew other people were doing it, then shut down one of their accusitions, Fingerworks. The author of the reading was interviewed about Wayne Weterman.

### So How Shoudld we theoroize Technological Evolution? Raymond Williams' Critique of MccLuhan?
Everything is related to everything else, but so what, how does it help us with understanding the world?
In Williams' way, he was thinking about television. Alot of you probably know that Marshall McLuhan was very interested in Television. McLuhan said it's not what's on TV, but the TV itself that's changing life. From this, McLuhan introduced the idea that the Medium is the Message. He became famous for saying more and more cryptic things. Raymond Williams was instead interested in culture. He got a visiting position in the US (Stanford) and looked at how we talk about how technology is understood. In his words, he said 
> "it is often said that the television  has altered our world... But this may be the centeral difficulty: that we have got so used to statements of this general kind, in our most ordinary discussions, that we can fail to realize their specific meanings."

From this, we need to look at is the iPhone changing everything. Is it the question of the iPhone at hand? the form or the content? It's not just an analytical question, depending on how you answer it, it changes what you're going to do about it. Using social life. That understanding is going to shape what is going to be done. It's not just about analysis, but acting in the world. Now, Williams in this passage or this part of the chapter, describes two common forms / habits of thinking about technology. 
1. Technological Determinism
was embraced by Marshall McLuhan in "The Medium is the Message". This basically said that technology pops out of a lab somewhere, then sets the condition for social change and progress... For example, the steam engine, the automobile, the atomic bomb, havve made modern man and the modern condition.

If you look at the Big Bang Theory intro, it's a comedic view on the evolution of technologies. I'm not saying that the creators of "The Big Bang Theory" are technological determinists. It's implying various forms of technological determinism without being specific about what's causing what. There are two strains, Symptomatic technology and Technological Determinism.

2. Symptomatic technology: 
> "Acknowledges other causal factors in social change [eg. captialism]. It then considers particular technologies, or a complex of technologies, as ymptoms of change of some other kind."

There are several ways to look at technology. Read it through the lens of something symptomatic of that technology. It reads technology as symptoms of other kinds of change.

3. Raymond Williams understanding of technology:
> "Each position, thouhg in different way, has abstracted technology from society"
- Raymond Williams

Audience Question: Would you say that these are in opposition between Technological Determinsim and Symptomatic Technology?
- No. They have an understanding of eachother.
