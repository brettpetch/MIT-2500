#### Prof. Thomas Streeter

I threw alot of very diverse meaning to you. It might take a bit to connect the dots. Now I'd like to set this up. You may remember Raymond Willimas, who was sceptical of McLuhan's idea that television changed society. The idea of McLuhan's technological determinism is not that simple. Technology is not outside of social institutions.
> "The invention of television was no single event or series of events

If TV is not just out of a research lab, how to we look at this life-defining thing that we call TV? Williams calls this "Mobile Privitization"
> "Broadcast television was a response to ..."

> "Systems of mobility and transfer in production and commmunication, whether in mechanical and electric transport, or in telegraphy, photography, motion pictures, radio and television, were at once inccentives and responses within a phase of general social transformation. ... there was a crucial community of selected emphasis and intention, in a society characterized by general levels by a mobility and extension of the scale of organizations: forms and growth which brought with them immediate and longer-term problems of operative communication... **In no way is this a history of communications systems creating a new society or new social conditions** (this is steeter's work). In the decisive and earlier transformation of industrial production, and its new social forms, which had grown out of a long history of capital accumulation and working technical improvements, created new needs but also new possibolities, and the communications systems all the way down to television, were their intrinsic outcome."
- Raymond Williams


towards his argument of tV being embedded in society, he backs up and looks at the history of communications of technologies. He talks about mobility, production and communication Incentives and responses, he doesn't want to say these things mechanically caused social change, but instead looked at it as these things being there to create incentives... I can do something with that. The steam boat, etc. created an international... By 1890, you were interested in what was going on in MTL, Ottawa, in the far west, the south, in the US, and institutions were getting bigger. All of that mobility, we needed to coordinate everyone's behaviour with a social order.

> "There is an operative relationship between a new kind

It's not just figuring out price of goods in far away cities, it's how are we going to organize our social relationships. 1972, men as all people. Relations between people and things, specifically the relation between things had very little to say. For example, a church or a town square in a little market, or maybe your kids went to school. Your family (extended) defined your experience. That wasn't working enough any more. People wondered how you were supposed to live life? People would give answers but they'd typically be inadequate. If you want an example of this, your marriage was arranged by a local matchmaker in your village and they'd say "this is your wife". Now, you can get a train ticket and work hundreds of miles away. Arranged marriages started to taper off and attraction starts to be important. 

In terms of media with all this social change, was the rise of newspapers. They met social needs of a new kind. Helped with vote, etc. Even until the 1930's it didn't include all white men, and women weren't added until the 20th c. As newspapers started to appear, the newspapers became a new social institution. People objecting to newspaper due to policy. If you didn't like the local paper in the US, people would burn it down. There were hundreds of cases of social upset like this in America. This created an increased awareness of mobility and change. It wasn't like academia, where people needed to restructure, but instead the function and process of social communications. This was all being turned upside down.

Mobility , by williams here we can get a sense of mobility was like in a peasant village versus life today. In a peasant village, life was defined by a social family, everyone knew who their cousin was and felt a duty to them. People lived on or near a farm, travel was expensive, horse, boat and foot were the only methods of transportation. People spent their entire life living a few km from where they were born. People's lives were rooted in church, family and tradition. Today, we move around quite a bit more than we used to. It is not uncommon to go 60 km each way to work. People are doing this by the 10's of thousands. People choose to live far from their place of birth, some 10's of thousands of kilometres. Home is not where you were morn necessarily. This is a new, modern condition. One of these is that we are in contact with strangers all of the time. You see strangers everyday. You are visible to them, they are visible to you. It becomes possible to become lonely in a crowd. In tradition, loneliness means you were actually separated from society. Being near people meant being connected. Now, we can be near people and not feel entirely connected. It's a peculiar thing. It's said that your cellphone contact list is a better map than a map of your neighbourhood. You're still in contact with people who are far away.

Now, privitization, in response to all of that mobility, people increasingly cut themselves off from people around them. We live in apartments, not caring to know who we are around. College students are the least privatized than the rest of societies. The separation of work, play, private and public is a lot blurrier. You go into some distance, take off the tie, take off nice clothes, you're in a different space. That is a very modern thing. You are at work, behave differently, act differently, say different things, etc. We start to appreciate the strong divisions between the public and private. We create a quiet space away from work. We call this the domestic scene. This is the notion that Privatized spaces are where we consume and use technologies: refrigerators, cars, plumbing, media. 

Now, this set of trends has been a long time coming. In Paris of the 1850's, for the first time they redesigned Paris from a medieval city with narrow allies to wide boulevards that enable people to mingle that we now see in many city centers. The Flaneur was a person wh could hang out. Baudelaire said
> "For the perfect flaneur, ... it is an immense joy..."

Sitting at a cafe, watching people go by. We've all done this right? People watching, not watching people you know is a very modern experience. You are connected, but not to people. This became a shallow way of comms. This was celebrated as early as the 1850's.

Calling cards / name cards were used by the rich to upper class for people to leave. If you wanted to find someone, "HEY WHERE'S ____", eventually the calling card became a societal norm. There's one where they're talking about Laura, the teenagers (young people) as a special thing save up their money and go to the print shop, buy cards and go to the square and share the card with their friends. In the little town on the prairie, young Laura trades cards with who would soon be her husband. The point here is that using technology to step into a world to encounter strangers. This idea of presenting yourself using technology has been going on for a while. 

# Nazi Gernmany
Now, there are other institutional responses, and it kind of pains me to go into this kind of example, and is not irrelevant today. There is an authoritarian movement that forced social anxiety that forced itself into Italy, Japan, etc. In a world where people were unsure, in that world, one answer is I'll tell you how to feel like part of something... There are these other bad people somewhere. They are worse than us, they're bad, we're good, etc. That could be jews, chinese or koreans. It could be lower casts of your society, different religions. We're going to make you feel like a group, and make a powerful binding force for some people. You discourage private life, make people participate. People were not just asked to watch a show, but to participate in the culture (Nuremberg Rallies). Being part of a public rally, at the time will tell you it felt fantastic. It's the feeling of being part of something yourself. Privatizing was something not used by Nazis, and instead neighbours would rat you out, etc. For the history of Broadcasting, the Nazi era they had one of the first broadcasting services in the world. What they did is they created "TV Parlors" they created mini theatres in the berlin area, and had intention of bringing the country together. It would be the way of getting people together to hear the latest (Nazi) news. Here's just a few clips that were captured on film from Nazi TV with subtitles.

That last clip is using double-entendres to talk about shipping around jewish people. It was not publicly announced that people were being killed in camps. One way to tell the story is that Hitler made them feel like a street gang, strength through joy. The Nazis were very much about strength. Now, the moral here is that there are different ways to respond to the alienation and confusion people feel in the modern world. There is not one way to do it. Authoritarianism offers a solution to social problems. If you way of bringing people together is separating them, it often ends in bloody conflict. A substantial percentage of the human population went in this event. It's about how mobile privatization is just one way to do it. It's not just the only way. Questions or comments about this?

# Broadcasting to the Home:
Back to Raymond Williams, what he says, if you're trying to understand the radio communications: the radio had become a major sector of industrial production. This became a major part of national and international business. Radio was being sold to people alongside toasters, stoves, cars, refrigerators. This is where he starts moving towards the term mobile privatization. On one hand, mobility, on the other the self-sufficient home. Broadcasting as we know it was a response to the tendency of mobile privatization. Part of what he's saying is that mobile privatization is inseparable from Mobile Privatization. The idea of suburbia is that you need a way to connect from inside the home, and becomes a whole way of life. 

# The Media and Mobile Privatization
The institution of broadcasting: mobility was only part of teh independent curiosity. The old ways were part of the condition of the new mobility. It also then created new places to live, and work and increase separation between them. All of this stuff comes together around the small family home. Privatization, which was at once an effective achievement and a defensive response, carried as a consequence, an imperative need for new kinds of contact. 

The media brought mobile privatization into privatized spaces. Media encouraged mobile privatization. The advertisements on TV and your television screens are all examples of how great privatized life is. The ads, etc. encourage us to participate in the privatized phones, etc. 

So, just to back up and talk through the development of the ways of living:

```
1880's: Telephone exchanges in cities
1900: RCA made dog famous, made photography accessible to everyday people. Recorded music and photographs. 
1910-30's: Phone service begins to become common. The first cheap motor vehicle (Model T) by Henry Ford started emerging.
Late 1940's: Beginnings of 45 records, cheap, created a whole new aspect of music industry, top 40 radio started to appear. 
1979: Sony Walkman
2002: Most phones in world are cell phones.
2005: Facebook
2008: iPhone was released.
```

Raymond William's argument was that all of these gadgets are our response to an inducement of a mobile privatized lifestyle. We are increasingly invited to create private personal bubbles for ourselves. There is no technological wizardry involved, but the cup holder in the car. Everyone wanted cupholders. This functionality is to make it feel like a living space rather than a vehicle. 

You don't want to live in an apartment complex, the complex is designed to be a private space that we interact with. iPods, etc. iPhones and other smart phones define our lives. This is an unsurprising picture on the subway now, where everyone is on their cellphones. 

A rock concert, church: people no longer use lighters, but rather cellphones. It does bring forth the question "are we increasingly alone together?". We're not going to look at this together, but rather look at touchstones of this. strength of weak ties: Granovettter: there are strong ties in social life, where you're very closely connected. Your best friends, your strong ties are not going to get you a job or new business. Instead, you look at these weak ties, they may be a friend of a friend, someone you have a very tenuous connection with, you can start going through a list of acquaintance, etc. to try getting a job. Weak ties provide access to resources instead of intimate ties. You need a certain amount of that to get by. 

Extensive vs. intensive reading. Intensive reading is when you read just a little bit. The question is what is the balance of these things. 

Questions so far? So, Sherry Turkle, Alone Together is concerned that we are relying too heavily on weak ties. It's a matter of degree. We are forgetting how to do intimate bonds and have communication without purpose. TMI is a phrase that emerged alongside social media. We've lost touch and people tell you too much personal stuff... This is an ongoing discussion we are going to continue through the semester. This is why in the session I bring up this essay, The "Third Place". The First place is the home, the second place is work, and the last is your public (churches, cafés, clubs, libraries, book stores, parks). The workplace is novelty and diversity. The idea that you are the employee, I am the boss, etc. You can put those things aside if you want to. Going for drinks with colleagues requires a pretty good boss. IT's not about fulfilling a specific goal, but rather a specific goal, or function we are trying to preform.

The idea of hangout commentary. [Letterkenny](https://trakt.tv/shows/letterkenny) is similar to this, where people just stare at the camera, tell jokes and make fun of eachother. Film: Diner

So, before we get into the question, it's guys talking about nothing, being emotional about nothing with no particular point. The producer saw this scene, thought it needed to be cut, director fought for it. It's also the same year the TV show [*Cheers*](https://trakt.tv/shows/cheers) came out, if you haven't seen *Cheers*, prehaps you've seen [Friends](https://trakt.tv/shows/friends) a lot of the action happens in the coffee shop. Deep interaction with people you know who are not part of your immediate family often seem to be crucial. The woods behind the high school. The idea of hanging out. The third places, I think it works as a description of social worlds we create, question is
> "are there electronic third places?"

Can they really fulfil the same function?

In a short answer, sure: people go online and amuse themselves, playing video games and interacting with other players. The cases for me that are most compelling are, this is going to sound obscure, but it has a point. People who have rare medical conditions and connecting with people who have it, it's so bonding and satisfying. There are many things at work. You can then know "yeah, I know what it feels like". It gets disturbing when people say "oh yeah...". Sometimes online there is a shared embodied experience that connects people. 

Question from the floor: "Because you are online, and are able to connect with more people, is that what makes it satisfying?" 
In short, yes. When someone pipes up from 1/2 way across the planet, the modern political organizing on the internet, the strategy on the US left was began with using the internet to get people face to face. you find people, then get together. The first major internet campaign: Dean... No one knew him outside of Vermont. There were meets, organized online. They broke out online. Bernie Sanders campaign was very similar to this. The question is SCALE: how much can come out of that campaign? On the opposite end of the spectrum: he did no tv advertising, but did large rallies to organize support. There's still this question of are electronic functions functional or dysfunctional?
