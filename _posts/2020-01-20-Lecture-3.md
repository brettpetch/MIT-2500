# Feelings
#### Prof. Thomas Streeter

Before lecture, see [Readings for Week 3](/week-3/)

## Introduction 

Last week, we looked at Black Mirror and closes a systematic loop. There is an important morale to the story: economic structures can absorb all kinds of things. Just because you aren't the most repatious captialist in the world doesn't mean you're part of this system. At some point you won't want to imagine yourself as a marionette (a puppet). This is what we are calling "The World of Feelings". Now feelings seem strictly personal, while they are strictly to a being, people live lives through feelings and our feelings do not come from a vaccuum; it's something going on to make you put on blue jeans. In other kinds of places, that's not what college students would have thought. Where do surprises come from? Live is not rigid in structure, there is much that happens that no one predicted would happen. Today, we are going to talk about the dictivity of feelings. 

Today, you read difficult material: Raymond Williams - when I pick up that chapter, which I've read many times, I still have to work through it. If you've never seen it before, I imagine it would be quite difficult. When reading something difficult, you may wonder "why can't he write in plain english". With a difficult reading, it is important to give it space. Look at the diction of the text and admit if you don't understand something. I'll help you with that reading today in a variety of ways. I would like to call to your attention to the reading.

## What Shapes how We Think?

Beethoven: interrupted the entourage, in the early 1800's it happened more and more. Marx noticed the nobel people were not getting the respect that they wanted. Marx sorted out social change. He'd seen things like Beethoven; noticed that people organized production differnetly in the city. He made a generalization based on something that no one had looked at before. Using capital as a way of organizing life. 

> "The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of societym is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the roling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance"
- Karl Marx, *The German Ideology*

Giving lords overhead: Futal Lords had clasp of mounting soldiers, horses, etc. As big piles of money and patterns of investment, people rejected the idea of the heiarchy. Marx saw this as an attack on Feutal Heiarchy. The ideas of the ruling class impact the ruling ideas. Is that the whole story?
- If we live in Neo-liberal Capitalism -> does that make me a Neo-Liberal Capitalist thinker?
How else can you think despite the insight. It really explained alot. 

## Social Structure and Everyday Life
In question, from the days since Marx. Social structure is real, it's there: Marx was right. However, poeple are complicated ,active, imaginative, but people are sometimes unpredictable. But more importantly, people act through their understandings, their perspectives, not as marionettes. People use their imagination to create ideas. How does everyday life relate to structure?

Something basic about human communication. Everyday discourse between people is one of the things that define us. You might think that one person has an idea, then communicates it through language. As an aside, apologies for the stick figures on the slide. You may just be exchanging information. Suppose one person is thinking "what's for lunch" and the other person is thinking "i love you and i want to be with you forever"... What would happen if left person told right person what they were thinking straight out to eachother... Do you guys still say "awkward". One person might say "cold outside, isn't it?" other person says "sure is". People aren't usually relaying new information. You need to establish that you're ok with eachother. You meet a stranger, you can't just ask "do you think I'm attractive"? you need to establish relatively stable social relations with those around us. Most situations are just being OK with eachother. It takes energy, work. By the time you're in college, you're a master of communication, you can navigate complex conversations, etc. It's what early sociologists call micro-sociology. For Raymond Williams, most of culture, from the mundane to the grandest works, from talking about hte weather to Shakespeare or Star Wars, are one of the places where poeple actively react to, reporduce, and change social structures. The excerpt I gave you is in a dialogue with aspects with Marxism. It's part of the core principals in way people conducted marxist analysis. There is some kind of core in society: Patrearchal, racial heiarchy, capitalsist, etc. You lead based on these features. Williams doesn't try to aruge the points, but used the term "feeling" to distingish what is going on in everyday life from large generalizations. 

## Structures of Feeling Version I
Moments of social change: eg. Williams recalled the experience he had, upon returning to Cambridge University after service in WWII. "I had been away only four and a half years," he wrote, but as he reflected on the "strange world around" him, he concluded, "the fact is, they just don't speak the same language."
Raymond Williams: a "structure of feeling" is something that "is as firm and definite as 'structures' sugests, yet it operates in the most delicate and least tangible parts of our activity... We are talking about characteristic elements of impulse, restraint, and time; specifically affective elements of conciousness and relationships: not feeling against thought, but thought as felt and feeling as thought." 

Growing up after the french, american revolution: bowing felt like something he didn't need to do. Europe was going through an industrial capitalist revolution. Beethoven didn't think about those things, he just felt different. 

## What is the conteporary Structure of Feeling?
Can we talk about our own structures of feeling? In recent years (10-15 years) "is that really a thing?" people are not saying "is this waterbottle a thing", it's usually something social; a way of asking if something is OK: in reference to behaviour etc. asking that question is a question of "is something socially constructed is real? or is it sometihnig someone made up". Part of what is being asked, Your generation will have to talk about something. It's a way of manouvering. It's pretty fluid at least on an everyday level. It's crude: men wearing a dress, is that a thing? There is a kind of fluidity in alot of social norms. By fluidity, I mean it's changing alot or to expect change. It would be like knowing about a meme culture. Most undergraduates will talk about a meme, everyone will start to smirk... Sometimes I'll look at a meme and wonder what the hell is the point... That is an aspect of young people's culture today. You can't reduce it to an ideology, but you can certainly relate it back to structure of feeling. The creativity is in the captions: while being true and cutting it also says something about everyday life. 
>"Are alot of memes about anxiety?"

The rise of IG influencers: even if you can make money, why yould you go about it that way? Now,
