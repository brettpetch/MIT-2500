## Midterms
Because of makeup exams, we haven't graded all of the essays yet. Because of the curve, we need to get the makeups back. Grades will be posted some time this week. Midterms will not be handed back, although you may request an appointment with your TA to go over it during office hours.

## Essay Assignment
Thanks to all who submitted assignment. Two similar tech items, or different. "email is more important than television"... Reasons why... Instagram vs. Testing... Somewhere you should refer to two different technological instances, tightly construed. Think Raymond Williams, "Commercial Radio Broadcasting was institutional to a way of life"... 

I won't ask you to answer the philisophical questions, but think of a continum of technology opening a new place vs. a tech that forces you into a box.

## Last Week's Lecture
OK, I also have a bit of an update from last week's lecture. In that essay, I went through a bunch of instances of tech development, in PCs, radio and the internet. 
1. Established uses, big institutions (Military / Government).
2. New uses discovered by marginal groups (amateurs / hackers)
3. New technological arragements are brought back into structures

See chart in lecture slides:

|Phases |Radio |Computers | Internet |

How that then related to dominant structures in the 1990's... It's not merely Streeter's ego, but he thinks you should read a case study in relation to Raymond Williams' Structure of Feeling.

# Lecture 8: Media Technologies and Centralisation of Societies
One basic characteristic is that humans evolved as a species is that they used face-to-face communication to construct their world. Humans are born with a capacity to learn human languages. It's kind of how we evolved. Face-to-face communication is the core of human interaction. It has simple characteristics:

1. Turn taking
2. Constant feedback
3. Close, intimate knowledge of others
4. Assumption of equality, reciprocity, sharing
5. But what happens to all that when humans communicate via technologies. 

If you ever want to test this thing, some believe that this is hard wired. Do this only with someone you trust and trusts you. When you walk through the door, just open the door and stare at them. I promise yourself between 20-30 seconds in that person would ask "what's wrong" because that is the normal human condition. Humans used to be in hunting-gathering bands (10-50 people), interacting with people who have advanced intimate knowledge. It's not like you only know a slice of a person. In normal human interaction, there is an assumption of equality, reciprocity (take turns, share information), and an assumption of sharing. That's the basic form that humans gather and communicate in. This is in the feedback, turntaking, sharing. What happens to humans when we talk through time and space. You can't get constant feedback, you cant assume much about said person. Media theory concerns "how do we deal with the strangeness of it", where media does not necessarily need constant communication. 

One way to frame this, is when people start talking at distances is how do humans create social connections across time and space. This is sometimes through "imagined communities", because they cannot share direct face-to-face communication. Modern constructions of human community are shaped by many things, however we couldn't do all of the other things, becasue they're bound to communication at a distance. As the modern world has emerged, it's connected people but not always in ways we might want. Media can distract, disempower, promote dividsive propaganda, or divide people. To think that through, how do we create answers to the question? How do I think of myself as part of a larger community. It's a fairly accute one. We do / there are patterns of what we know or what we can say about how things play out in some cases. 

## The The Idea of the Nation-State
One key piece of the puzzle is the Nation-State in 1648, there was an idea of a nation state. At this point, Europe had been put through terrible terrible religious war. Much was misaligned, completely chaotic mess, large parts of corruption. A bunch of leaders realized that they needed to come up with a better way to deal with each other. They started to cook up the idea of the nation state. The state is a political and geopolitical entitiy; the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity. So whether it be China, Canada or the US, each have their own limitations to culture, and have some kind of shared identity. Each nation has conflict over boundaries. The Nation State is the most important unit in the world today. A range of ideas on the table (in the states), but not the nation state. 

> The Nation " is an imagined political community -- and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign."
- Benedict Anderson

This was enabled originally by "print capitalism", vernicular language early newspapers. If you are a nation, you cannot know everyone in it. In the nation, all the people share that they are part of a national identity. 

> "It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion"

> "Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings"

What does it take to make someone willing to die for something? Maybe a few people will die for a religious principle, but most people are willing to die / kill for their nation. For our purpose, this is important through mass media, which create a larger, modern sense of "us" of "we the people". It wasn't until recently they you could go to a coffeehouse and read / see a newspaper that address you as a member of a nation.

I also understand that you are all addressed in multiple different ways, whether it be a member of Nation X or Y, in living in the nation state must be a personally complicated issue. That's much more acute for your generation.

## Power of Margined Communities: Napoleon and the origins of modern patriotism
When the people of paris rose up against the French royalty and cut off the heads to reform government, after the french revolution and alot of chaos, a young soldier named Napoleon stepped up (possibly heroically) as the king of france. The existing kings of royalty in Europe, who did not like that the French were wanting to cut off the heads of kings. Militaries of the kings of europe were descending on Paris to take back France from the rabble and return it to nobility. 

Napoleon had no money and no standing armies, but discovered he could mobilize unheard of numbers of young men in the name of "la patrie", love of country. He conquered most of Europe. He did so not in the name of divine right of kings, but did it in the fraction that was france.

### The Role of the Newspaper in Revolution and Propaganda.
Absolutely essential to this was the french newspapers, which reported the dealings of the new French government and after power was siezed, Napoleon used it as a propaganda. People were being addressed as "Citizens of France" rather than people of your tree, not as prodistants or catholics, but as citizens of France. This changed how the world worked. He was defeated, not by the royal families, but because the families of Europe started turning ot similar structures. The heros of the war did it in the name of Britain, not in the name of the king. 

Now, those 19th c. experiments flowered in the 20th century, when the ideas of the radio, television came along they were essential to nation-building efforts. If you were concerned with creating a national identity, radio broadcasting is the tool that you needed. These efforts have often been fraud. Canada is a classic illustrative example. In the early 20th century, Canada was a bunch of colonies, in the 19th c. Canada was afraid that the US would rise up and take Canada, which eventually created a de-facto... Canada still produces robustly critical media, which is allowed to criticize the government, but also creates a strong need for defining a Canadian identity. Francophones in QC would much prefer to be their own nation. They have not signed a Canadian constitution. In the most current election, the Albertains have been wanting to break free.

The Russian Federation is similarly diverse, but in contrast with Canada, the media has a pretty heavy thumb of government on it. There is a certain amount of debate / criticism allowed, however not much. Canada has an agreement to have disagreement, but hold strong in our differences. Nation building has it's dark sides. 

## The Case of Charles Coughlin & Radio Broadcasting
A catholic priest who used the then-new technology in 1927, he said "i'm going to use this" the Ontario diases looked a little scance about a priest being so public. Give your sermons over the radio. In 1933, he was picked up by CBS, broadcast across nationally, and it was considered to be an astounding audience. It would make anyone in advertising desperate for the audience.

He started tspeaking on behalf othe poor and downtrodden during the depression. People were suffering in all kinds of ways. He was suspicious of bankers fore-closing on houses, etc. Watched the new deal, which used government money to help people. One of the things to help people was that radio was not a place to give lectures, it wasn't the same as a stage, but rather used a style that was ideally suited to what would be heard in the living room. Coughlin had "a voice of such mellow richness, such manly, heartwarming confidential intimay such emotional and ingratiating charm, that anyone tuning past it almost automatically returned to hear it again." He was one of the first people to make you feel like he was talking in your living room just between you-and-me. People liked it, and is how they got these huge audiences. Now, what happened is as the 30's progressed, he became so famous that he'd try to take this to another level, he started holding rallies in public, talking to huge groups of fans and became obsessed with the federal reserve bank and bankers. His concern about evil bankers started to lean towards the discussion of "evil jewish bankers", which aligned him with a certain amount of semetism.

By the 1930's, he started to advocate fascism. Started softening the relationship between american and... "

> "From european entanglements, from Nazism, communism and their future wars, America must stand aloof. Keep America safe for americans and the stars and stripes the defender of god"

> "When we get through with the jews in America, they'll think the treatement they received in Germany was nothing" "Jewish persecution only followed after Christians were first persecuted"

Started attributing people to their communities, told people that it was other people creating these problems. It was a very compelling message in those days. Similarly, Roosevelt also learned to do this using his, what they called "Fireside chats", in the 30's there were struggles of power to create communities of different types, not only to say that we are communities, but also denounce other "non-good" people. 

This potential was and still is everywhere. It was not only just Italy, etc. that take over this fascism. 

(in slides, we will embed the links to clips and such)

One of the ways we got to the way we are today was after WWII. WWII was in some ways the worst human-caused catastrophe in human history. There was alot of search for a modern media that would not lead to authoritarianism. Can we make these serve as neutral, objective, non-partisan institutions to keep the power to mobilize people at bay. This became the social responsibility theory of the press. For example, in the States, there was a rule created for broadcasters that fair coverage was needed for both sides of an important event. Known as the "Fairness Doctrine". In Canada, in the 1951 Massey Commission established alot of the features of the CBC radio television and the regulations for private commercial radio broadcasters. You cannot use the airwaves for purely partisan purposes. 

If the fairness doctrine had been appealed in the 50's, there would be no Donald Trump. 

### Two Poles of Imagined Communities: Solidarity vs. Debate
Now, Philisophically, there were two poles. There are times when this is the obvious case. I want the media to address the issue of the Corona Virus, we need procedures to follow, any solution to the Corona Virus is not "your problem" but rather a collective problem. The media is also a place where differences can be openly allowed, addressed, and dealt with in the sphere of democratic debate. 

1. Community as Solidarity: Defines community as unified, together, the same.
2. Community as a place where differences can be openly allowed,addressed, and dealt with -> a sphere of democratic debate.

## The Idea of a Public Sphere
One of the most famous theories of what we're going for his Jurgen Habermas' Public Sphere. It comes from turn taking, realizes that it's universal... We are all turntaking talking animals and a public sphere is an idealized version of how we want to re-create the face-to-face situation in a mass-mediated world. In some ways the public sphere is the idea of a public space where people can talk. Literally tanslated from German, it's translated to openness. It's somewhere that everyone can participate somehow. It should be a public space where people are able to talk in an unconstrained way. This classroom is not unconstrained, where Prof does one thing, and students do another. People have to be on different terms. 

People also have to fall into rules or norms of discourse. If we have to talk for our minds to be changed. Now, you might say "that never happens", Habermas says that this does occour, one example being the Parisian salon, where people would just debate things. It was ~1700's... What is / how does science work... Same with English Coffeehouses, where people asked "do we really need kings"... Giving women citizenship was considered to be something new... 

In America, they were drinking beer not coffee when they thought up the revolution. There was a loose assumption that you were kind of equal. These were all very narrow, and societies were very unequal. In the US, they were slave owners, it was extremely limited, but it was the beginning of something (according to Habermas), and it liberated and changed the world.

### The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere
Some people, he defined the public sphere as a virtual or imaginary community. You couldn't do that in a modern community. The eneeds of the society and the state. It's what articulating guidance for the state. You needed assemblies, dialogue which served to affirm or challenge the state. In this book, he noted that by the mid 19th c. modern press emerged, (penny press newspaper) where small groups of people would define what people read. This became a one-way, sensationalist, and advertising supported media. This caused Habermas to believe that the public sphere had declined. 

Habermas felt that the Public Sphere was a work-in progress and thought that you don't just interact with large audiences. People don't want to just go to ~100 meetings a week... Who want's to do that? Habermas thought of the life rule, where williams talked about culture and structures of feeling. There is the life world and then there are the larger structures, the system that interrelates. It should be part of everyday life. Need to make a living, need to go to work. Gotta pay my taxes, gotta not park here because I'll get a ticket. 

Habermas wanted to imagine a world where the lifeworld (culture / feeling) and the system (social structures) interact. And so, at one point he said what do democratic socieites do to make this work. If you ever feel like a tool of IG / Snapchat and have advertisements thrown in your face through aggregating data, Habermas was about tying people's everyday lives to the encroachment of systems of everyday life. 

### Free Market Media and the Centralization of Opinion: The Case of the Vietnam War in the US
I want to return to some history here, with free market media and the Vietnam War. Between 50-60 mil. americans and vietnamese died. As the war was being conducted in the 60's, antiwar protesters, many of them college students started to speak out with concern about the war. If someone was ~ your age (19-20), people were drafted into the war. One of the things that happened at the time, if you look at media in 66/67, the coverage was dismissive of protesters and took on a patriotic side. This is a cover of the Chicago Tribune, where in 1965, the marines landed in vietnam, heroic coverage of the troops that were sent there. People are wondering if it's a bad idea. The media were very reluctant to cover the protests in a thorough way. Why did the media take so long to come around / why didn't they do a better job?

Now, another thing that was going on at the same time, voting was treated as an ad campaign. A famous case was in 1968, assasinations, protests, Nixon was the republican candidate. After he was elected, a book was released called "the selling of the president". Said that he could negotiate a better deal than democrats. He used advertisers rather than politicans, didn't use candidates and citizens to discuss problems, etc. Won in 68, then won re-election in '72. Then, there was a watergate scandal, where he resigned in disgrace. People were not interested in democracy. In 1962, politicians were considered to be trustworthy individuals, today all americans are sceptical of candidates / politics. 

In 68, we see a sharp dropoff of american voter turnout. Canada turns ~60-65 percent voter turnout, where the US only gets 50-55. What happened and how can we fix it?

### Hallin's News Doughnut
There are alot of liberals wondering why the media is so limited in it's coverage of such things like the Vietnam war. Daniel Hallin became a scholar and a critic who write a book "Uncensored War" and came up with a theory of Doughnut of legitimate debate. The idea is that even in the commercial media, which is not directly censored by the government is that the discussion is limited to a set of issues, where in the US Two-Party System, where at the core is reporters and editors assume people are aware of: you will not see the discussion of whether we should have nation states. Outside that is teh Sphere of deviance, where views are considered to be too "crazy" and non-legitimate. Protesting the war was considered to be a sphere of deviance. It was not people who had a difference of opinion, but someone who was deviant. It serves as a description as to how alot of journalism seems to work. 

### Joseph P. Overton "The Overton Windpow" Model of Political Acceptability
It's not just people from the left, but rather a libritarian. The idea of completely private schools was considered crazy. He watched charter schools and home schools becoming legitimate. This kind of shifted thinking. In the 1960's, the Democrats led a passage that marriage can only be between a man and a woman. Thought to be never-acceptable. Bit by bit, things started to change. You now live in a country that same sex marriage is legal and respected. That's quite a shift in what's considered illegitimate. Now it's right there in the middle of it. In the conservative party, they are (catholics) not on board with same-sex marriage / abortion. If you were to read the Globe and Mail / CBC, you would not see this article, as they are in the doughnut of illegitimate discussion. 

### Chomsky and Herman's Propaganda Model
Wondering why the media was so limited and inaccurate to the Vietnam War. By using the word propagnda, which is an old war, favoured by lennon in the lennonish theory of marxism in WWII as a nessecary thing. We aren't just going to do propaganda. In Herman just said "you don't see how you're doing it", so they say you look at media coverage and see that based on servicability to public dominant power interest. Institutions get to define the sphere of debate. You can see it in quality / volume of coverage, it's massive and systematic but even when news media does cover inconvenient materials differ at the ends. 

Yesterday in the media, Bernie Sanders had an [editorial run in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/business/media/bernie-sanders-media.html), where he calls himelf a Democratic Socialist, the media, particularly Fox News calls him a Socialist. 

#### Five Filters
- Financial Ownership
- Funding through ads
- Reliance on PR
- FLAK
- Anti-Communism and Fear

##### Financial Ownership and the For-Proift Model
Large for profit corporations are unlikely to encourage the production of news and entertainment that is critical of their own activites. They have an interest in depoliticising content and can influence the governments and media organizations to define their interests. In Canada, Bell, Rogers, Shaw and Telus dominate the media. In the US, Comcast, Disney, TimeWarner, 21st Century Fox own cable services, networks, etc. You can break it up world-wide in terms of ownerhip, in 2013 the Murdoch Group (USA) had the top revenues, followed by the Government of China, Google was 3rd. It kind of says alot about our world. There is media concentration and that of course filters what becomes news. 

##### Funding through ads
There are times when advertising interferes with news, reporting. The pressure of ad support makes media content that works as "advertising packages". If you're a fan of american comedies, like Friends people often live in a place they can't afford. It's unrealistic. If you're making an advertising package, you have to dress it up. Advertisers don't want product being shown in realistic battered places.

##### Public Relations
There are more jobs in public relations than there are in Journalism. They don't always succeed, but they are definitely good at it. Governments often hire PR firms to make their case

##### FLAK
Negative responses to media statement or program. In the Vietnam War, they ran an hour long program talking about the pentagon's efforts. Nixon was threatening the broadcast licences after ... attacked CBS, if you were a news-programmer at CBS, they got so much government threat / etc. deciding not to do shows like that again, kind of backed off. 

##### Anti-Communism and Fear
"Ideology" was enormously powerful from '50-'90. Bernie Sanders put the kibosh on socialism being anti-american. Most young americans are like it's not a monsterous evil that needs to be stopped. It was associated with... there were movies made when I was a kid (streeter) where they'd do dramas and one of the kids was in a family that... Anti-communist. Our side is for democracy, etc. Was often used to justify support ofr authoritarian and corrupt governments. 

##### After the 80's
- Globalization of media and economies
    - fall of the SU
    - Entry of the People's Republic of China into the World Economy
- Increasing Development of new media technolgoies.
    - VCRs, CDs, DVDs, computer games.
    - Multichannel cable tv and satellite tv spread
- News Centers of media production begin to emerge: Bollywood, Japan
- Questions Raised: Who are the new imagined communities? Are thetre any? How do you do democracy? Will it be reduced to consumerism?

All of these appeared starting in the 80's and into the 90's. Started to spread through developed countries, what it did was... the propaganda model is a hard sell because there was so much available. Before these changes, most media globally, US to the rest, etc. 

### Nicholas Garnham , Media, Cultural Identity and the Public Sphere (1993)
Central Question: What would a democratic media look like in a globalizing world?

After the 1980's: fall of teh soviet union, opening of the people's republic of china to the world market. "Anti-communism" no longer had a point.

Garnham "How then, as citizens of the world, should we think the relation between the globalisation of the mass media and the future of democratic politics? the concept of the public sphere offers the soundest bass for teh analyiss and political action necessary to rebuild the systems of both communication and representitive democracy"

"First, so far as teh meida of communication are concerned... [o]nce commuunication is mediated, these universal equalities can no longer be guaranteed. Even in a situation of face-to-face communication it was arly recognized that unequal access to the learned manipulative skills of rhetoric could and d id influence the outcome of democratic debate. But in an institution of mediated communication, access to both channel and means depend on the mobilization of scarce material resources, the distribution of which is dependant on the very structures of economic and political power that democratic processes of debate were intended to control."

" Second, what has also became mediated is the content of communication and the subject of debete..." (see slides for rest of quote)

#### Issues facing a mediated public sphere
The problem of respectful communication: one of the problems is to ... troll... it's divorced from the people actively governing worlds. A second issue is the problem of centralized, commercial media production: it's not just that it's bad people that run HBO, but these networks are heirarcacle, and are for-profit and are for-profit and follow rules very different than that of democratic discourse.

**One of the things he has to tackle is universal relativism.** Some people say
> "look, every community around the world has their own truth. You know, there is alot of concern for minority groups and giving their point of view respect. you need some universal ground to create a public sphere. As long as there are dangers of elite domination, of intolerance, chauvinism, and xenophobia, are recognized, there is clearly both a political case and a political demand for the defense of national and local cultural autonomies against the growing domination of global networks of cultural production and distribution that is, as a minimum, the citizens of a polity can talk among themselves about those things that affect them and about the collective actions they wish to take in response."

The french want a network exclusively in French, for people to experience french culture...

**Does poltical thought have to be limited to news?**
> "The position on the public sphere argued here can be criticized on the grounds that it overvalues politics and a particular model of rationalist discourse at the expense of disregarding the modes and functions of most media communication, which is non-rationalist and is concerned with psychological and imaginative satisfactions that have little to do with politics"

#### Garnham Summarized
> "With regard to the relationship between the institutionalized practices of mass communication and democratic politics, I take it as axiomatic that some version of communicative action lies at the heart of both the theory and practice of democracy. The rights and duties of citizens are in large part defined in freedom of assembly and freedom to impart and receive information. Without such freedom it would be impossible for citizens to possess the knowledge of the views of others necessary to reach agreements between themselves, whether consensual or majoritarian, as to either social means or ends; to possess knowledge of the actions of those whom executive responsibilities are delegated so as to make them accountable; and ot possess knowledge of the external environment necessary to arrive at the appropriate judgement of both personal and social interests..." (see slides)

To summarize:
People want freedom and community. And in an interconnected world, media technologies are essential to those. Media technologies do not guarantee equality or freedom. Modern media have often worked to turn peoples against each other. But any solution to the problem requires some kind of communication-at-a-distance. 

Next Lecture: Using two decades of experiments, particularly the internet using electronic media to solve these problems.
